# Agent guide — main-dash-sh

This is the self-hosted Gainium dashboard. Public repo, FCL-1.0-Apache-2.0
licensed. Cloud overlay (`main-dash-redesign`) consumes this repo as a
`core/` submodule, so changes here ship to both self-hosted users and the
hosted cloud product.

## Release ceremony — REQUIRED on every PR

Every PR that changes user-visible behavior MUST do both of these in the
same PR (not a follow-up):

1. **Bump `version` in `package.json`** following SemVer:
   - `MAJOR` (`x.0.0`) — breaking change (config schema, license-gate
     behavior, public component API contract changes).
   - `MINOR` (`2.x.0`) — new feature, new section, new setting.
   - `PATCH` (`2.8.x`) — bug fix, copy tweak, refactor with no UX delta.

2. **Add an entry at the TOP of `CHANGELOG.md`** in
   [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format:

   ```markdown
   ## [2.8.8] - YYYY-MM-DD

   ### Added | Changed | Deprecated | Removed | Fixed | Security

   - One line describing the change from a user's perspective. Reference
     the affected feature/page, not the code path.
   ```

   - Use today's date in ISO format.
   - Group bullets under the right `###` subsection. Multiple subsections
     are fine in one release.
   - Phrase bullets as observable outcomes ("Restore the reports params
     in `getNavigationSections`"), not commit subjects ("fix bug").

The downstream Docker image is tagged from `package.json` version. Skipping
the bump silently re-uses the previous tag and breaks reproducible builds.

### When to SKIP the bump

Only docs-only changes (README, CONTRIBUTING, CHANGELOG itself, LICENSE,
CLA, this CLAUDE.md, comments) and CI-only changes (`.github/`) may ship
without a version bump or CHANGELOG entry. If in doubt, bump.

## Before pushing

CI runs `npm run type-check` then `npm run lint` on every PR (including
drafts). Run them locally first:

```bash
npm run type-check
npm run lint
```

Both must pass. `lint:check` (used internally) is stricter — it fails on
any warning, not just errors.

## Commit messages

Follow the repo's existing commit style — see recent `git log` for the
convention. Co-author trailers are fine; the CLA workflow allowlists the
common AI assistant emails.

## Things this repo does NOT do

- No mocks of the trading backend; integration tests hit a real `app-sh`.
- No backwards-compat shims for removed feature flags — delete cleanly.
- No `*.tsbuildinfo` committed — `.gitignore` covers it; if you see one
  staged, drop it before pushing.
