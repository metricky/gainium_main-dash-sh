/**
 * CREATE-mode coverage for the bot-form save path.
 *
 * botFormRoundTrip.unit.test.ts probes 163 fields per bot type and every one of
 * them runs `mode: 'edit'`. So did every other test in this directory — before
 * this file, `grep -rn "mode: 'create'" tests/` returned nothing. That is a real
 * hole rather than a bookkeeping one, because create is not edit with a
 * different verb. It runs machinery edit never touches:
 *
 *   - `buildCreatePayload()` spreads the WHOLE raw form slice as the payload
 *     base, minus four fields it destructures away (`useExperimental`,
 *     `avgPrice`, `indicators`, `indicatorGroups`).
 *   - `mergeCreatePayload()` then spreads the mapper's output over that base.
 *     The layering direction is the whole ballgame: this function used to put
 *     the factory defaults ON TOP of the user's values, the same defect class as
 *     the fallback-layer bug fixed in core baabc97.
 *   - `sanitizeValue()` drops empty strings, nulls and EMPTY ARRAYS from the
 *     mapper's output, so for those keys the raw base layer is what ships.
 *   - combo create additionally does `delete createPayload.importFrom`.
 *   - and the backend stores a create VERBATIM (`prepareDCABot` does
 *     `settings: { ...settings, type }`) with no defaulting, where edit merges
 *     `{ ...oldSettings.settings, ...settings }`. On edit an omitted field keeps
 *     its stored value; on create an omitted field simply does not exist.
 *
 * The method here is differential: for the same form state, run the mapper
 * twice and diff `createPayload` against `updatePayload`. Edit is the direction
 * with 163 probes behind it, so any field that is right on edit and different on
 * create is a create-only defect — and the diff needs no per-field oracle, which
 * is what makes it affordable to run over every field at once.
 *
 * Result as of this commit: for all 158 probeable fields, on both DCA and combo,
 * create and edit agree exactly. The only systematic difference is the seven
 * empty-valued fields listed in CREATE_ONLY_EMPTY, which create ships as `""` /
 * `[]` from the raw base where edit omits them. That is pinned below rather
 * than asserted away, so it shows up as a diff if the set moves.
