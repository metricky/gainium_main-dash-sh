/**
 * Save round-trip coverage for the bot form.

 * The form's own bindings are checked statically (scripts/verify-form-bindings.mjs).
 * This covers the other half: a field that binds correctly but does not survive
 * form -> payload -> form. That is the "I saved it and it didn't stick" class,
 * and it is invisible to both type-check and the binding checker because the
 * mappers are two independently-written field lists that can silently drift.
 *
 * Method: build a baseline with every feature gate ON (so gated fields actually
 * serialize), then for each field set it to a distinctive value on its own, run
 * the round trip, and assert the value comes back. One probe per field keeps a
 * failure attributable to that field instead of to some upstream toggle. Fields
 * the baseline cannot reach on its own — a gate it has to leave off, a
 * structured fixture the mapper validates against — get a PROBE_COMPANIONS
 * entry that is applied alongside the probe.
 *
 * A field that legitimately does not round-trip belongs in KNOWN_NOT_PERSISTED
 * with the reason. Anything not listed there is expected to survive.
 *
 * Coverage is currently total for the flat fields: 163 of 163 probed for both
 * DCA and combo, none skipped, none rejected, none normalized away. That is
 * enforced, not just observed — see the blind-spot guard at the end of the
 * first test. `indicators`/`indicatorGroups` are the deliberate exception and
 * belong to the indicator-specific suites.

/**
 * Fields that NO mapper writes — i.e. the mappers' coverage gap.
 *
 * READ THIS BEFORE INTERPRETING THE LIST. It used to mean "the fields that
 * silently revert on save", because the payload was assembled as
 * `{ ...DCA_FORM_DEFAULTS, ...finalData }` — a field the mappers skipped did
 * not arrive absent, it arrived as the FACTORY DEFAULT and overwrote whatever
 * the user chose. That is no longer so: the fallback layer is now the live
 * form slice, so an unmapped field ships the value the user is looking at.
 * The revert is prevented structurally, and pinned by the "no mapper gap can
 * revert a field to its factory default" test in formDefaultLeaks.unit.test.ts.
 *
 * So this list is now a COVERAGE pin, not a bug list. Being on it means only
 * that no mapper normalizes or validates the field — its value is passed
 * through. `debugInfo.fieldsMapped` is literally `Object.keys(finalData)`, so
 * anything missing from it is a field the mappers leave to the fallback.
 *
 * It still earns its place. A field arriving here means it lost its mapper,
 * and with it any gating, coercion or validation that mapper performed — which
 * is a real regression even though the user's value now survives.
 * `closeOrderType` was the motivating case: TakeProfitSettings offers it for
 * every non-combo, non-hedge bot with no dependence on the close condition,
 * while the mapper only wrote it under `techInd`/`dynamicAr` — so on the
 * default take-profit condition a user's MARKET was rewritten to LIMIT.
 *
 * This list is pinned in BOTH directions on purpose. A new entry means a field
 * just lost its mapper. A removed entry means one gained one and the list
 * should shrink to record it. Do not "update the pin" to make the suite pass
 * without establishing which of the two happened.
 */
/**
 * Verdict for every field in NEVER_MAPPED, established by driving
 * `mapFormDataToBackend` with each field's feature switched ON and checking
 * `debugInfo.fieldsMapped` and the mapper's own errors:
 *
 *   'bug'       — control is reachable, no validation error, value discarded.
 *                 Since the fallback layer became the form slice, a gap alone
 *                 no longer discards the value, so this verdict now means the
 *                 field needs the mapper's normalization/gating and isn't
 *                 getting it — not merely that no mapper writes it.
 *   'by-design' — deliberately stripped before the payload is built.
 *   'no-ui'     — nothing in the app writes it; not user-reachable.
 *   'gated:x'   — the mapper writes it once x is active, and the UI only
 *                 offers the control there. Correct.
 *
 * Every pinned field must appear here — the suite fails otherwise, so a field

     * flags ~45 correctly-gated fields per bot type.

     * The unambiguous defect is narrower: the payload carries EXACTLY the value
     * that was set, and the form still gets something else back. The forward
     * mapper accepted the edit and the reverse mapper dropped it — the user's
     * change is written and then lost on reload. No configuration makes that
     * correct.

     * Where the payload carries something other than what was set, the forward
     * mapper normalized it; that is gating, and it's reported, not failed.
