 * currently holds (`addDealFunds` / `reduceDealFunds` in main-app core

 * divided by price as a quote amount — with a single `type === perc` branch
 * that sizes off the POSITION. There is no percent-of-balance path in the
 * engine, so `OrderSizeTypeEnum.percFree` would be read as a plain quote
 * amount and silently place a wildly different order ("40" becoming 40 USDT
 * rather than 40% of the balance).
 *
 * So the percentage is resolved in the dialog, against the balance shown next
 * to it, and submitted as a fixed quote amount. The consequence worth knowing:
 * it is pinned when you confirm, not re-read at execution.
 *
 * Reduce does not offer it — a reduce is bounded by the position, which is
