/**
 * Trailing / stop-loss state of one open deal, derived the same way the bot
 * engine derives it (`core/src/bot/dcaHelper.ts` in main-app).
 *
 * The engine keeps the *live* trailing stop in three persisted deal fields —
 * `trailingMode`, `trailingLevel` and `bestPrice` — written together by
 * `triggerTrailing`. Everything else it uses (the arm price, the effective
 * stop-loss price, the move-SL trigger) lives only in the worker's memory, so
 * the dashboard has to recompute it from the deal's own settings.
 *
 * Two rules this module exists to keep straight:
 *
 * 1. **`trailingMode` is a latch, not a hint.** `getDealStopLossPrice` refuses
 *    to return a trailing exit unless `trailingMode && trailingLevel` are both
 *    truthy, so a deal whose price is deep past its trailing-TP arm price is
 *    still NOT trailing while those fields are empty. Never infer "trailing"
 *    from `bestPrice` alone — `bestPrice` is written on every new extreme
 *    whether or not trailing ever armed.
 * 2. **Deal settings win over bot settings.** The engine merges them as
 *    `{ ...botSettings, ...deal.settings }`, so a deal opened before a setting
 *    changed keeps its own snapshot. Read the merged view, never the bot's.
