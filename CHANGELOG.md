# Changelog

## [2.82.1] - 2026-10-06

### Fixed

- Backtesting a DCA or Combo bot with Risk:Reward enabled and a Fixed % stop loss no longer fails with "At least one indicator is required"; a Risk:Reward indicator is only required when the stop loss type is Indicator.

## [2.82.0] - 2026-10-06

### Added

- Indicator condition "Between" for value-type indicators (RSI, CCI, MFI, Williams %R, ADX, AO, UO, MOM, VO, BBW, BBWP, %B, Keltner %B, MA ratio, ATR, ADR, ATH): pick "Between" and an "Upper value" field appears next to Value; the condition holds while the indicator is strictly inside the range. Replaces a "Greater than" + "Lower than" pair with one indicator. Not offered with percentile. The chart shades the band between the two bounds, and editor backtests evaluate it (needs `@gainium/backtester` 1.11.0).

## [2.81.0] - 2026-10-06

### Added

- Bot Events: filter events by time range, type (orders, deals, errors, warnings) and pair, search by order ID together with those filters, and export the filtered events as CSV. Wider widgets show the events as a table with an order/deal column; filters move into a two-column panel when the widget is narrow.

### Changed

- The bot error/warning banner's "Review the bot events" link now opens the Events tab filtered to errors (or warnings), also when the Events tab is already open.

## [2.80.1] - 2026-10-06

### Fixed

- Charts show prices with the exchange's own precision. Low-priced pairs quoted in USD, EUR, GBP or JPY were rounded to 2 decimals on the price axis and crosshair, so for example every price from 0.065 to 0.075 read "0.07".

## [2.80.0] - 2026-10-06

### Added

- Backtest results, Deals tab: sort the deal list (deal number, start/close time, P&L %, P&L $, duration, safety orders filled, volume), filter it by outcome (all/wins/losses/open), P&L, duration, safety orders filled, start date and pair, and export the shown deals as CSV. Prev/next follow the shown order.

### Fixed

- Backtest results, Deals tab: the selected deal no longer jumps back to the default one when the bot form behind the results re-renders.

## [2.79.1] - 2026-10-06

### Fixed

- Bot Statistics tab, Lifetime / Since views: the confidence grade and its deal count now follow the selected view. They showed the count since the last stats reset in both views, often zero deals.

## [2.79.0] - 2026-10-06

### Added

- "Restart deal" is offered on hedge DCA and hedge Combo deals too.

## [2.78.1] - 2026-10-06

### Fixed

- Bot Statistics tab, Lifetime / Since views: "Win, %" now matches the Win Rate donut (break-even deals count as neither), and in the Since view the per-pair table's range chip shows the since-change period instead of "All time".

## [2.78.0] - 2026-10-06

### Added

- "Restart deal" in the deal actions menu (bot deals table and trade cards) for open DCA and Combo deals. It cancels and re-places that deal's safety orders and take profit without restarting the bot or touching its other deals. Needs a backend with the `restartDeal` mutation.

## [2.77.0] - 2026-10-06

### Added

- Bot Statistics tab: a Lifetime / Since-last-change toggle for bots whose statistics were reset by a settings change. Lifetime figures are derived from all of the bot's deals and keep counting across sizing and profit-currency changes; return and drawdown are measured against the peak capital the bot used at once. An info icon explains what each view counts. Run-up, ratios, buy-and-hold and DCA usage show in the Since view only. The toggle is hidden for bots that were never reset and on backends without the lifetime query.

## [2.76.5] - 2026-10-06

### Fixed

- Deal tables on large accounts: when every deal of the list was already loaded, a Symbol filter showed no deals at all, and Cost and date filters were ignored (the whole list was shown). Symbol and date filters are now applied to the loaded deals; Cost, which the loaded deals do not carry, is answered by the server.

## [2.76.4] - 2026-10-06

### Added

- Bot name columns (deals, bot lists, latest orders, terminal orders) and the Global Variables name column offer "Is any of" / "Is none of" with a dropdown of the names in the table, alongside the text operators. A picked name matches that name only, not every longer name containing it.
- Close Trigger columns in the deal tables offer the same dropdown.

### Fixed

- On large accounts whose deals page on the server, "Not contains" and "Is none of" on Bot Name and Symbol were shown as not applied; they are now sent to the server. The Bot Name dropdown there lists the account's bots, not only those on the page on screen.

## [2.76.3] - 2026-10-06

### Changed

- Includes the fixes released in 2.69.10–2.69.11 (listed below).

## [2.76.2] - 2026-10-06

### Changed

- Includes the fix released in 2.69.9 (listed below).

## [2.76.1] - 2026-10-06

### Changed

- Includes the fixes released in 2.68.4–2.69.8 (listed below).

## [2.76.0] - 2026-10-05

### Added

- Bot form: host extensions can render a block under the base order size (`BotFieldExtensionPanel` for `baseOrderSize`).
- Deals: a `deal.badges` slot after a bot deal's pair on the deal card, in the bot drawer's deals table and in the deal detail.

## [2.75.1] - 2026-10-05

### Fixed

- Backtests list: a browser copy of a server-stored result (downloaded to show its deals) replaced the server's row, so the row lost its name, "server side" and source; the server's row now wins, and a downloaded copy is never listed as a row of its own (one with a variant id showed as a new backtest created "now").
- Backtests list: a backtest where no deal closed shows "No deal closed" instead of 0% for its returns.

## [2.75.0] - 2026-10-03

### Added

- A bot form backtest action's finished-run summary can carry a `note` that replaces the net / win figures in the "View results" chip when they are not a result (e.g. no deal closed).

## [2.74.0] - 2026-10-03

### Added

- A results extension can report that its replacement result failed to load (`resultError`, with an optional retry): the results modal shows an error state with Retry in the content area and keeps the row's own header, instead of an empty result.

## [2.73.0] - 2026-10-03

### Added

- A bot form backtest action can report a run in progress (`running`: progress, text, detail, cancel) and a finished one (`done`: summary, view, dismiss); the footer's backtest box shows them with the same progress bar and "View results" chip as a normal backtest.
- Backtest source kinds can keep a row out of the list until it is ready (`listed`), and a row's results can be opened from outside the backtests panel (`requestOpenBacktest` / `subscribeOpenBacktest`).
- `MultiSelect` takes a `contentClassName` for its list (e.g. to open above a dialog).

## [2.72.0] - 2026-10-03

### Added

- Bot form backtest actions can render their own UI inside the form (`element`, e.g. the dialog the action opens), so it can use the form's pickers.
- The pair picker can offer only a given set of pairs (`allowedPairs`), let its caller handle the "change pair" of the last chip (`onReplaceCoin`) instead of writing the form's pair, and open its list above another dialog (`modalZIndex`); the list dialog takes a `zIndex`.

## [2.71.0] - 2026-10-03

### Added

- Extension points for host builds around backtests: buttons next to the bot form's Backtest button (run on the form's current, unsaved settings, validated as Save would), an action on a backtest limitation item, and backtest result sources — rows of the Backtests table produced by another process, with a Type column, a status beside the name, an inline expansion, and additions to the results modal (a result selector in the header, extra tabs, chart markers with their own toggle on the Deals chart, a per-deal card and deal-list badges). With nothing registered the table and the modal are unchanged.
- Tables can show an inline detail row under a row, sized to the visible width of the table.
- The chart can draw note pins (hover text) among a backtest's transactions.

## [2.70.0] - 2026-10-01

### Added

- Settings → Notification Preferences: a slot at the end of the card (`settings.notificationChannels.footer`) for host-provided content. Empty in the self-hosted build.
- Host builds can ask open bot forms to re-check which extension sections are visible (`invalidateBotFormSections`), e.g. when an access flag arrives after the form mounted.

## [2.69.0] - 2026-10-01

### Added

- Extension points for host builds: a component can be attached to an individual bot setting (next to the global-variable control) or to a bot form section, and may take the setting over (hiding the variable binding and locking the field); extra tabs in the bot details drawer, reachable with `?tab=`; badges after a bot's name and extra filters in the DCA and Combo bot lists. With nothing registered the dashboard is unchanged.
- More extension points for the bot form: a block under an individual setting or at the top of a section, a section-header highlight, whole extra form sections, extension settings kept in the form and saved by its Save button after the bot itself, and decorations for a bot's header in the details drawer and the bot form. The Take profit and Stop loss "More Settings" groups open by themselves while an extension manages trailing take profit or trailing stop loss.
- AI color tokens (`ai-surface`, `ai-surface-strong`, `ai-border`, `ai-foreground`) for light and dark themes.
- Backtest limitations: before a DCA or Combo backtest, a dialog lists the settings that are on for the bot but can't be simulated in a backtest (webhook signals, volume filters, global variables, Combo trailing / multiple targets and others), with what the backtest does instead. It never blocks the run, and "Don't remind me again" is remembered per setting, so a newly applicable one still shows. Host builds can add their own items.
## [2.69.11] - 2026-10-06

### Fixed

- Bot details panel: on touch screens, dragging the panel's left edge or the divider between the chart and the bot info with a finger now resizes them, as dragging with a mouse does on desktop.

## [2.69.10] - 2026-10-06

### Fixed

- Grid bots: a Short futures grid with a take profit or stop loss target price is now checked as a short grid, so a take profit below the range or a stop loss above it can be saved again. Futures grids are judged by their position side, as the bot itself trades them.

## [2.69.9] - 2026-10-06

### Fixed

- Notifications: an update or news item whose text is cut off now always shows the expand arrow. Short items made of a heading and a few paragraphs could be cut off with no way to expand them.

## [2.69.8] - 2026-10-05

### Fixed

- Trading bots list: a DCA bot holding an open deal on a pair that was later removed from the bot showed that deal at zero value, so unrealized PnL read as a loss of the deal's whole cost. Assets whose names use lowercase letters (such as stock tokens) are now priced correctly.

## [2.69.7] - 2026-10-05

### Fixed

- Backtests list: a browser copy of a server-stored result (downloaded to show its deals) replaced the server's row, so the row lost its name and "server side"; the server's row now wins and the copy only marks that its details are in this browser.

## [2.69.6] - 2026-10-05

### Fixed

- Grid bot page: opening the Settings tab no longer removes the bot's grid order lines from the chart; they stay visible when you return to Overview.

## [2.69.5] - 2026-10-04

### Fixed

- Help articles and other pages with images no longer reload and jump back to the top every 15 seconds; the startup loading check now only reacts to an app that never rendered.

## [2.69.4] - 2026-10-04

### Fixed

- Bot edit page (Grid, DCA, Combo): the chart opens on the bot's own pair instead of BTCUSDT while the exchange's pair list is still loading or failed to load.

## [2.69.3] - 2026-10-04

### Fixed

- DCA bot form: Move SL is available again when the stop loss type is Indicators or Dynamic ATR/ADR, as it was in the legacy dashboard. Once the deal reaches the trigger profit, a percentage stop loss at the "Move to" level is armed alongside the indicator stop.

## [2.69.2] - 2026-10-03

### Fixed

- Grid bot form: a local backtest now reads a decimal comma the way saving the bot does (`1,5` runs as 1.5 instead of 1 or not-a-number), and a value that is not a number (`1000abc`, `1,000.5`) stops the backtest with an error on the field instead of running with a silently wrong setting.

## [2.69.1] - 2026-10-03

### Fixed

- Grid bot form: clearing the Grid levels field, or typing a value that is not a whole number (`20.1`, `20,`), no longer freezes the page on a geometric grid. The field now keeps only whole numbers of 1 or more and shows "Levels must be a positive integer." for anything else; leaving the field restores the last valid count.

## [2.69.0] - 2026-10-03

### Added

- Bot form quick backtest: the period picker now has start and end time inputs, so a backtest can start and end at a time of day instead of only on whole days. The chosen times also carry into the Backtest settings dialog.

### Fixed

- Bot form quick backtest: the picked period's last day is now included. The end date was read as midnight UTC at the start of that day, so the final day was left out of the test.

## [2.68.12] - 2026-10-03

### Fixed

- Hedge DCA and hedge combo bots now save their global-variable bindings. Creating, cloning or editing a hedge bot keeps each leg's bound fields bound to their variables instead of saving the variables' current values.

## [2.68.11] - 2026-10-03

### Fixed

- Cloning a DCA, combo or grid bot now keeps its global-variable bindings: a field bound to a variable stays bound in the clone instead of being saved with the variable's current value.
- Bot form: a base order sized in % of balance no longer shows a "Minimum order: 0 %" note. The note now appears only when there is a real minimum.

## [2.68.10] - 2026-10-02

### Fixed

- Grid bot form: a number typed with a decimal comma (`1,5`) in a grid field such as Sell displacement, Grid step, Investment or Take profit % is now saved as `1.5` instead of `0`, and a value that is not a number shows an error on the field instead of being saved as `0`.

## [2.68.9] - 2026-10-02

### Fixed

- Deal lists paged on the server (Trading Bots → Deals, the bot drawer): the Symbol column's "is any of" filter now offers every pair of the loaded deals and of the bots' configured pairs, not only the pairs on the page on screen, so a pair on another page can be found and several pairs picked at once.

## [2.68.8] - 2026-10-02

### Fixed

- Grid bot list and drawer: on a neutral futures grid, Net PnL, Unrealized PnL, Run up and Drawdown now value the open position against the same entry the bot's percentage take-profit and stop-loss use, so a run-up no longer shows above the take-profit while the take-profit has correctly not fired. Futures grids also value the position as quantity × price change, the same measure the bot itself uses. Needs the matching backend release.

## [2.68.7] - 2026-10-02

### Fixed

- DCA and combo bot lists: Net PnL % on a bot with nothing open now divides by max cost, as the column tooltip describes, instead of always reading 0%. The bot drawer's Net PnL % does the same.

## [2.68.6] - 2026-10-01

### Fixed

- Cloning a DCA, combo or grid bot now opens the form with the source bot's settings. An older unsaved new-bot draft is no longer restored over the clone.

## [2.68.5] - 2026-10-02

### Fixed

- Adding deals to the trade journal (from a bot's deals table or the trading terminal, one at a time or in bulk) no longer creates a second entry for a deal that is already in the journal. Deals already present are skipped, and the notice says how many.

## [2.68.4] - 2026-10-01

### Changed

- Quick-mode bot forms: the "Risk profile" section is now called "Preset", since the values are calculated from the pair's price history, not from the user.
- Preset descriptions no longer call deeper safety-order ladders "protection"; they state how deep each preset covers and how much capital it commits.
- The calibration line under the presets now notes that it is based on past data and that future moves can be larger.

## [2.68.3] - 2026-10-01

### Fixed

- A session that expires or is rejected by the server no longer ends silently: a "Your session expired — please log in again" notice is shown, the login page repeats it, and signing in returns you to the page you were on.
- A request refused for authentication is reported as a failed load instead of an empty result (for example an empty list), and prompts a check of the session.
- An expired session is no longer cleared without notice when a request finds it expired, and a temporary network failure while re-checking it no longer signs you out.

## [2.68.2] - 2026-10-01

### Added

- Turning on "Disable all webhook actions" now lists the active bots that start or close deals by webhook and asks for confirmation first.
- Bot forms warn under Deal start, Take profit and Stop loss when Webhook is selected while webhook actions are disabled for the account.

## [2.68.1] - 2026-10-01

### Fixed

- Bot form: the multi-pair switch is no longer locked for free-plan users on a Hyperliquid connection with the builder fee approved. The server already accepted multi-pair bots on those connections; only the form refused them.

## [2.68.0] - 2026-10-01

### Added

- Settings → Login & Security: "Disable all webhook actions" switch (cloud) that refuses every incoming webhook signal for all bots on the account.

## [2.67.24] - 2026-09-30

### Fixed

- Trading Bots: the DCA bot list no longer stays empty ("No DCA bots yet") for an account that has never saved a live/paper preference. The list waited for the trading mode to be synced from the profile, and a profile with no saved mode is never synced, so the list was never requested.

## [2.67.22] - 2026-09-30

### Changed

- Connect an app (OAuth consent): the app name shown is now the one the app registered with, looked up from the server, and the screen shows where you will be sent after you decide. A request whose return address the app did not register is shown as not valid, with no Authorize or Deny buttons.

## [2.67.21] - 2026-09-30

### Fixed

- Trading Bots and Combo Bots: a bot whose details cannot be displayed no longer makes the whole page fail to load. The rest of the list renders, and a bot that was already showing keeps its last good values.
- Grid Bots: a bot missing its stored pair details now reads its base and quote assets from its pair instead of failing to render.

## [2.67.20] - 2026-09-29

### Fixed

- Bot form: with no trading pair selected, the chart and the Investment currency now follow the selected account's own default pair instead of always showing BTC/USDT. Accounts that cannot trade USDT pairs (for example OKX Europe, which lists USDC and EUR pairs) no longer see a USDT pair and a "0 USDT" balance that they cannot use.

## [2.67.19] - 2026-09-29

### Fixed

- Backtest results: opening a deal from a fine-interval run (for example 1m) far in the past no longer leaves the chart loading while it fetches every candle between that deal and today. Deals too far back to load at the run's interval are shown at the finest coarser interval that loads in seconds; recent deals keep the run's interval.

## [2.67.18] - 2026-09-29

### Changed

- Charts: the "chart never became ready" diagnostic now records how far the charting library got (script, chart frame, library start-up), counts only the time the page is visible so background tabs no longer produce inflated waits, and sends at most one report per page load. The 30-second threshold and the retry behaviour are unchanged.

## [2.67.17] - 2026-09-29

### Fixed

- Bots: "Duplicate to paper" / "Duplicate to live" now switches to the other trading mode and opens that bot type's new-bot form in Manual with the source bot's settings, on a matching account of that mode, named "(Paper)" or "(Live)". It used to open a default Quick-setup bot in the same mode, and did nothing for combo and grid bots in the table view.

## [2.67.16] - 2026-09-29

### Fixed

- Trading Bots: a bot whose stored pair details were empty made the whole page fail to load. The list now reads that bot's pairs from its settings and shows it normally.

## [2.67.15] - 2026-09-28

### Fixed

- Deal orders (Trade Details → Orders → Pending): cancelling a placed safety or add-funds order with the red X works again. The request left out the bot the deal belongs to, so the server rejected it with a "botId was not provided" error and the order stayed open.

## [2.67.14] - 2026-09-28

### Fixed

- Pair picker (Select Pairs / Change pair): scrolling the list shows every pair again. When the picker opened with its pairs already loaded, only the first screen of rows was drawn and the rest of the list scrolled as empty space, for any sort order and on any device.

## [2.67.13] - 2026-09-28

### Fixed

- Deals lists (Trading Bots → Deals and the Trading Terminal's deals): "Export as CSV" and "Export as JSON" include every deal that matches the current open/closed view, filters, search and sort, not only the rows on the visible page, when the list is paged on the server. If the full fetch fails, the export falls back to the loaded rows and says so.

## [2.67.12] - 2026-09-27

### Fixed

- Trading Bots → Deals: clicking or tapping a column header (Unrealized P&L, Net P&L %, Cost, …) sorts the open deals again. The table no longer switches to server paging for good when a deal closes while the page is open. A table that had switched to it on an earlier visit goes back to sorting on the device once its whole list is loaded. When the list is paged on the server, sorting by Unrealized P&L, Value or Cost asks the server instead of leaving the rows in place.

## [2.67.11] - 2026-09-27

### Fixed

- A dashboard tab left open across an update no longer turns into the "Something went wrong" screen when an optional panel (such as the Max chat panel) or widget cannot be loaded: the page reloads once onto the new version, and if that is not possible the panel is simply left out while the rest of the page keeps working. A page that fails to load the same way reloads instead of spinning forever.

## [2.67.10] - 2026-09-27

### Changed

- Moving Average indicator: the settings now read in the same order as the stored rule and the API/JSON: the moving average first, then the condition, then what it is compared to (e.g. "EMA 100 · Lower than · Current price"). The condition list uses the same labels as every other indicator, so "Greater than" is `gt` and "Crossing up" is `cu`. Previously the form put the reference first and swapped the condition labels to compensate. Existing bots are unchanged and behave exactly as before; only the wording of their MA conditions reads from the other side.

## [2.67.9] - 2026-09-27

### Changed

- Exchanges page: a unified account shows as one card (account name, its markets, Edit / Delete per market) instead of one card per market
- Portfolio Futures card: the futures markets of one unified account are one row with the shared wallet shown once

## [2.67.8] - 2026-09-27

### Fixed

- Portfolio: the market connections of one unified account (Hyperliquid unified, Bitget UTA, Bybit / OKX unified) show as a single box in My Accounts with the shared wallet balance once; "All Exchanges" and the Futures card total no longer add that wallet again for every leg

## [2.67.7] - 2026-09-26

### Fixed

- Large lists paged from the server: a saved or linked filter on a column that
  cannot be filtered in that mode was still counted on the Filters button,
  with nothing shown to clear it. Those filters are now ignored there and
  dropped from the page link

## [2.67.6] - 2026-09-26

### Changed

- Price polling sends plain requests, so browsers no longer make an extra
  preflight request before each price refresh

## [2.67.5] - 2026-09-26

### Fixed

- Hedge bots: the Stats tab showed only the long leg's statistics, presented
  as the whole bot's. Each leg keeps its own statistics, so the tab now has a
  Long leg / Short leg switch and shows the selected leg's figures

## [2.67.4] - 2026-09-26

### Fixed

- Sign in: an email address filled in with capital letters (for example by a
  password manager) was rejected as "Invalid email or password". The email
  field is now lowercased, as on the legacy dashboard

## [2.67.3] - 2026-09-26

### Fixed

- Bot Edit page: a paper bot opened from inside the app while the dashboard
  was in live mode showed no safety orders and 0.00% coverage until the page
  was refreshed. After a live/paper switch the previous mode's pair list was
  saved as the new mode's list, so the new mode's pairs were never loaded;
  the list for the new mode is now fetched

## [2.67.2] - 2026-09-26

### Fixed

- Bot details: the chart could open on a pair from a different bot. Orders
  saved in the browser without a bot id were shown on every non-hedge bot, and
  the chart followed the newest of them. They are no longer read or saved, and
  any already saved are dropped on load

## [2.67.1] - 2026-09-26

### Fixed

- Time-based DCA/Combo bots: "Next deal" showed a day off from when the bot
  actually runs for users away from UTC; it is now a date in the profile
  timezone and matches the engine

## [2.67.0] - 2026-09-26

### Added

- DCA and Combo bots: with the dynamic price filter on "Over and Under",
  "Max open deals" (and "Max open deals per pair" on multi-pair bots) can be
  split into separate limits for deals opened above and below the first
  deal's price.
- DCA bots: "Volume based on (beta)" controls — size each DCA order so the
  deal needs only a set price change to reach its target, measured from the
  take profit or breakeven price, with a max volume per DCA.
- Hedge Combo bots: "Base take profit on" (Used DCA / Max DCA) for the
  combined take profit.
- Grid bots: saving new settings on a running bot that change the balances
  the grid needs asks how to cover the difference (buy or sell it, or
  proceed), as it does when the bot starts.

### Fixed

- The max volume per DCA seeded when switching to "Required change" no
  longer shows floating-point noise.

## [2.66.4] - 2026-09-26

### Fixed

- In Safari, a chart could draw its candles but never finish loading, so no
  order, breakeven or fill lines appeared (since the previous release it
  recovered after about 30 seconds). This happened whenever the charting
  library was already in Safari's cache. The library announces that its chart
  frame has loaded before the chart starts listening for that, and Safari
  delivers the announcement too early to be heard. The chart now notices the
  missed announcement and replays it, so it becomes ready immediately.

## [2.66.3] - 2026-09-26

### Fixed

- The bot create and edit pages no longer load every backtest ever stored in
  the browser. They now read only the 50 most recent of that bot type, the
  same number the server list shows. Each stored backtest keeps its full
  result, including a data point per candle, so a long backtest history could
  freeze the page or crash the tab with "Out of memory".

## [2.66.2] - 2026-09-26

### Fixed

- DCA and Combo bots keep their "DCA order type" (Limit/Market) and their
  Risk:Reward stop-loss type and value when edited. These were not read
  back, so a bot set to Market DCA orders or to a fixed Risk:Reward stop
  loss was shown with the defaults and saved with them.
- Editing a deal keeps its DCA order type, and changes to a deal's DCA order
  type or close order type are now saved.
- Grid bots have the "Fee Order" setting again (spot only, and only
  while the bot is not running). Editing a grid bot no longer switches
  it back on.
- A changed initial purchase price on an existing grid bot is now saved.

## [2.66.1] - 2026-09-26

### Fixed

- Grid bots have the "Skip Balance Check" setting again, in the Investment
  section. A grid bot that already had it on keeps it when edited and saved,
  instead of having it switched off.

## [2.66.0] - 2026-09-25

### Added

- **Partly filled base orders are visible, and you can finish them at market.** When a DCA bot's LIMIT base order only partly fills and the bot is set never to enter at market, the rest of the base order now waits as a limit order. The deal's Orders card shows a "Partially filled" badge with how much of the base order has filled, and a "Buy rest at market" button ("Sell" on short bots) that cancels the waiting order and takes the rest at market after you confirm.

## [2.65.2] - 2026-09-25

### Fixed

- "Load in settings" on the Backtests page and on a bot's edit page opens the
  new bot form with the backtest's settings, in Manual, instead of a default
  bot: the settings are mapped the same way as the new-bot page's own load,
  and a stored unsaved-bot draft no longer overrides them.

## [2.65.1] - 2026-09-25

### Fixed

- Backtest history "Load in settings" on a new bot form now fills the form
  with the backtest's settings: a stored unsaved-bot draft no longer overrides
  the load, and the form opens in Manual so the Quick risk profile does not
  overwrite the loaded strategy.
- Backtest history "Load details" on a new bot form opens the backtest results
  instead of leaving the panel blank.

## [2.65.0] - 2026-09-25

### Added

- Backtests page for every bot type (Trading, Grid, Combo, Hedge DCA, Hedge
  Combo) at `/<bot>/backtests`, listing server and on-device backtests in one
  table with results, share, export, delete, notes and "Load in settings", plus
  a "New backtest" button that opens a new bot of that type.
- "Backtests" sub-page under each bot type in the sidebar, above the recent
  bots.

## [2.64.3] - 2026-09-25

### Fixed

- Table column filters: numeric columns (profit, drawdown, cost, value,
  counts, prices, percentages) offer number operators — greater/less than,
  between — instead of text ones; dates offer date operators; statuses,
  strategies, exchanges and pairs offer a multi-select. Covers the bots, deals,
  backtests, orders, positions and balances tables. Duration columns filter in
  days (hours on deal tables), shown in the filter box; percent columns filter
  on the percentage shown rather than the stored ratio.
- Number filters no longer match rows whose value is empty ("-").

## [2.64.2] - 2026-09-25

### Fixed

- Charts: order lines, the Breakeven line, trade markers, past-order lines and
  signals no longer go missing when a chart opens quickly (for example the
  second bot opened in a session) or switches to another pair, resolution or
  saved layout. Anything sent to the chart before it could draw it was dropped
  and treated as drawn; the chart now keeps every overlay and draws it as soon
  as the chart has loaded, retrying until it does.

## [2.64.1] - 2026-09-25

### Changed

- Bot details → Statistics, per-pair table: "Max deal capital" becomes "Peak
  capital", the most the pair had committed at once across all its deals open
  at the same time, and return on capital is measured against it. On bots that
  run several deals per pair, measuring against one deal overstated the return
  many times over.
- Against a server without per-pair statistics, columns it never recorded are
  hidden instead of showing a dash on every row.

## [2.64.0] - 2026-09-25

### Added

- Bot details → Statistics: the per-pair table of multi-pair bots now has one
  row per pair instead of one column per pair, so a bot trading dozens of pairs
  reads as a list. It can be sorted by any column, searched by pair, have
  columns hidden, and be exported to CSV. Each pair shows its closed deals and
  win rate, realized P&L, return on capital, average P&L per deal, profit
  factor, deepest drawdown, largest deal capital, fees, average and longest
  deal duration, and its open deals with their current P&L. A period picker
  limits the closed deals to a date range; open deals always show the current
  position. Pairs the bot has never traded are listed too. Against a server
  without per-pair statistics the table falls back to the stored per-pair
  summary.

### Fixed

- Bot details → Statistics: profit factor is gross profit divided by gross
  loss. It was shown as the number of winning deals divided by the number of
  losing deals.

## [2.63.1] - 2026-09-25

### Fixed

- DCA deal chart and orders table: a safety order that had already filled could
  still show as a pending "Smart order", most visibly once every safety order
  had filled. Projected levels now skip the levels the deal has filled.

## [2.63.0] - 2026-09-25

### Added

- Bot Controller: two new limits, **Stop after X consecutive winning deals** and
  **Stop after X consecutive losing deals**. Unlike the total win and loss
  counts next to them, these count a run — the bot stops only when its most
  recently closed deals are that many in a row, and one result of the other
  kind starts the count again. A deal that closes at exactly breakeven counts
  as a loss, the same way the total counts treat it. Both are off by default.

### Changed

- Bot Controller: **Stop after X accumulated bot profit** is now labelled
  **Stop after X accumulated bot profit or loss**, and its tooltip explains the
  loss case. The setting already stopped a bot on accumulated loss — Less than
  with a negative value, for example Less than -100 for $100 of loss — but
  nothing in the row said so.

## [2.62.8] - 2026-09-25

### Fixed

- Bot details: after opening another bot while the details panel is open, the
  chart shows that bot's Breakeven line again. A Breakeven line requested while
  the new pair was still loading was dropped, and the chart then treated it as
  already drawn.

## [2.62.7] - 2026-09-25

### Fixed

- Bot details: the Breakeven and Smart order lines of an open deal no longer
  disappear a few seconds after the page opens. Restoring the saved deal and
  order cache replaced the deals and orders already loaded for the page, so a
  deal that was not in the saved cache (for example, one opened since the last
  visit) was dropped. The saved cache now only fills in what the page has not
  loaded, and a newer copy is kept over an older one.

## [2.62.6] - 2026-09-25

### Fixed

- Bot details: opening another bot while the details panel is open now moves
  the chart to that bot's pair and plots its latest deal. Before, the chart
  kept the previous bot's pair. The previous bot's orders could be filed
  under the new bot for a moment, and the deal auto-selection did not re-arm.
- Charts: take-profit and DCA order lines of a deal on another pair appear
  once that pair has loaded. A line requested while the new pair was still
  loading was dropped and never redrawn.

## [2.62.5] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- Settings → Shortcuts: typing in **Search shortcuts** no longer shows
  "Something went wrong". Removing a shortcut that was never registered (for
  example deleting a bot template that had no shortcut) saved an empty entry,
  and the search crashed on it. Such entries are no longer created, and ones
  saved by earlier versions are dropped when the page loads.

## [2.62.4] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- Self-hosted: the **Email me a link to set a password** button added in
  2.62.3 is no longer shown. Self-hosted accounts are created with a password
  and the self-hosted server has no email reset, so the button could only fail.

## [2.62.3] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- Settings → Change Password no longer insists on a current password. An
  account created with an email sign-in link or Google never had a password
  to enter, so the form could not be submitted and a password could not be
  chosen. The current password is now optional; the server decides whether it
  is needed and says what to do when it is.
- Settings → Change Password has an **Email me a link to set a password**
  button, which works for any account, including one whose owner does not know
  the current password.

## [2.62.2] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- Grid bot form: a **Custom %** field after the quick % buttons on Top price,
  Low price, Take profit price and Stop loss price. Type the size of the move
  (for example `50` on Low price for 50% below the start price); the direction
  is fixed by the field. When a price matches no preset, the field shows its %.

## [2.62.1] - 2026-09-24

### Changed

- The DCA setting is now labelled **Use available**, and its tooltip explains
  that in a multi-pair bot the available balance goes to one deal: the first
  pair to need it; the other pairs are skipped.

## [2.62.0] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- DCA bot form: **Use available** under Strategy → More Settings. When the
  free balance is insufficient for the full deal, the bot opens it
  with what is available, reducing the Base Order and every Safety Order by
  the same ratio, instead of skipping it. An optional **Minimum base order**
  skips the deal when the reduced Base Order would be smaller. Shown for fixed
  order sizes only (not % of balance, not Risk/Reward). Requires the matching
  backend release (new GraphQL fields).

## [2.61.3] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- A selected stock pair's chip in the bot form shows the exchange's spelling
  again (`rSPY/USDT`), matching its row in the pair picker.

## [2.61.2] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- In the bot form's pair picker, a selected pair whose exchange spells its
  base in mixed case (Bitget stock tokens such as `rSPY`) shows as selected
  and can be toggled again. Its row and its selected chip used identities
  that differed only by letter case, so the row never matched.

## [2.61.1] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- Editing a DCA or Combo bot no longer changes its Enter Market Timeout when
  the timeout is switched off: the edit form now loads the saved seconds
  (or the same default as a new bot) instead of 0, so saving an unrelated
  change leaves the timeout as it was.

## [2.61.0] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- Futures accounts with pooled collateral (OKX Multi-currency / Portfolio
  margin, Kraken flex, Bitget Unified multi_assets) show and use the pool for
  USD- and USDC-quoted contracts: the DCA and Combo forms' balance, the trading
  terminal's balance check and the grid bot start dialog no longer read 0 on an
  account funded in EUR or other coins.

## [2.60.1] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- The pair picker shows a stock's ticker as the exchange spells it: Bitget
  Reality tokens read `rMCD`, matching the selected pair, instead of `RMCD`.

## [2.60.0] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- OKX Europe X-Perp futures are generally available: any OKX Europe account
  (origin my.okx.com) can add the futures leg and build bots on X-Perp pairs.
  The add-exchange notice now points out that X-Perps are USDC-margined.

## [2.59.9] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- The pair search finds a stock by its company name as well as its ticker:
  typing "apple" lists the Apple pairs.

## [2.59.8] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- Charts: Bitget COIN-M perpetual pairs had no live candle updates. They now
  stream live on every timeframe except 3D and 1M, with the daily and weekly
  bars aligned to UTC like the chart history.

## [2.59.7] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- Charts: Bitget USDT-M futures pairs updated their live candle from the spot
  market, so the last bar showed the spot price instead of the contract's.
  USDT-M and USDC-M perpetuals and COIN-M delivery contracts now stream from
  their own futures market; USDC-M and COIN-M delivery charts previously had
  no live updates at all.

## [2.59.6] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- Trading terminal: on an account that pools its collateral — a Bitget
  Unified Trading Account in multi-assets mode — an inverse (coin-margined)
  pair showed a balance of 0 and a maximum order of 0 whenever the wallet held
  none of the contract's own coin, although the account funds such orders from
  its whole wallet. The balance under the order fields and the Buy/Sell
  buttons now shows the pooled margin in USD, and the maximum amount, maximum
  total and percentage buttons are sized from it.

## [2.59.5] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- Combo bot form: the safety-order preview on pairs with a coarse price step
  now shows each order at the percentage you set, the same fix as the DCA
  preview. Each level's mini-grid keeps its width. The preview matches where
  the bot now places the orders.

## [2.59.4] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- DCA bot form: the safety-order preview on pairs with a coarse price step
  now shows each order at the percentage you set. It used to let rounding
  build up from one order to the next, so the last order could show well
  above or below the configured depth (for example 35.7% for 30 × 1%).
  The preview matches where the bot now places the orders.

## [2.59.3] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- A chart whose page learns its pair only after the chart has started — the
  trading terminal restoring an unsaved bot, for one — now opens straight on
  that pair. The chart used to start on a default pair and could switch only
  once that pair's history had finished loading, which for a pair with little
  history includes asking for the years before it listed; the chart sat on
  "Loading chart…" for a pair nobody chose, for up to half a minute. A pair
  that arrives before the chart is ready now rebuilds the chart on it instead.

## [2.59.2] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- Trading terminal: an inverse (coin-margined) order on a pooled-collateral
  account is checked against the pooled margin on isolated margin too. The
  terminal defaults to isolated, and the previous release only consulted the
  pool for cross margin, so the default order was still refused with "Not
  enough assets to place order". The exchange decides whether it funds the
  position.

## [2.59.1] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- Charts on Bitget Reality stock tokens (`RAAPLUSDT` and the rest) update
  live. Bitget accepts the usual candle subscription for these pairs and then
  sends nothing, so their charts showed history but never moved until
  reloaded. They now stream from the exchange's unified kline feed at 1m, 5m,
  15m, 1h and 4h, and the 30m, 6h, 12h, daily and weekly charts are built from
  the next finer stream into the same UTC-aligned bars the history uses.

## [2.59.0] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- Pairs carry `underlying`, the ticker of the stock a tokenized stock tracks,
  and stock icons use it first. Bitget Reality tokens show the logo of the
  company they track, including one-letter tickers such as `rT` (AT&T).
  Against a backend that does not serve the field yet, the pair list loads
  without it.

### Fixed

- Bitget stock perpetuals whose ticker starts with R (`RDDT`, `RKLB`) showed
  the logo of a different ticker: a leading R was removed from every Bitget
  stock as if it were a Reality-token prefix. Bitget tickers are no longer
  inferred from the symbol's shape.

## [2.58.0] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- Trading terminal: an inverse (coin-margined) futures order on an account that
  pools its collateral — a Bitget Unified Trading Account in multi-assets mode —
  is no longer refused with "Not enough assets to place order" just because the
  wallet holds none of the contract's own coin. When the coin balance falls
  short, the terminal asks the connection for its pooled margin and lets the
  order through if that covers it. Isolated-margin orders and accounts that do
  not pool collateral keep the per-coin check.

## [2.57.9] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- Bot Edit page: changes you have not saved yet (a new name, a Custom volume
  filter size, any setting) no longer snap back to the saved values a few
  seconds later while the bot is running. They stay until you save or leave
  the page. What the form shows after saving is unchanged.

## [2.57.8] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- Combo bots with smart orders on now show the DCA levels a deal has not
  placed yet as grey lines on the deal chart, and as smart-order rows in the
  deal's orders list. Previously these levels were only projected when smart
  grids were also on, and then only the minigrid levels, so the chart showed
  just the one resting DCA order. Minigrid levels still show when smart grids
  are on.

## [2.57.7] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- Backtests: Share is no longer offered on a backtest result that is saved
  only in this browser (its save to your account did not complete), where it
  could only fail with "Backtest not found". The option is greyed out with a
  note to run the backtest again. Sharing a saved backtest is unchanged.

## [2.57.6] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- App updates are applied only when you click "Update Now"; a new version
  no longer reloads the page on its own after the update notice appears.

## [2.57.5] - 2026-09-24

### Changed

- Portfolio Futures card: net exposure values read "Long $428" / "Short $300"
  (Total: "Net long …") in neutral text instead of a green "+$428", which
  looked like profit. Green and red remain on the bars, meaning long and
  short.

## [2.57.4] - 2026-09-24

### Changed

- Portfolio Futures card: each coin's exposure bar now shows its total long
  and total short as faint bars behind the solid net, so hedged coins are
  visible at a glance. The gross Long / Short / Net figures moved from above
  the list into a Total row under "Other", drawn the same way on its own
  scale.

## [2.57.3] - 2026-09-24

### Changed

- Portfolio Futures card: net exposure now opens with a gross Long / Short /
  Net line, so a hedged book (large on both sides, small per coin) reads
  correctly at a glance. Net exposure is its own titled section, and
  "Manage in Terminal" is a button.

## [2.57.2] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- Portfolio Futures card: net exposure bars are scaled to the largest single
  coin. The "Other" row shows its total without a bar, so a long tail of small
  positions no longer flattens every other bar to a sliver.

## [2.57.1] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- Portfolio: the Futures card now follows the account selection in My
  Accounts like the other Portfolio widgets, and hides when the selection
  holds no futures account.

### Changed

- Portfolio: My Accounts makes it obvious when it is filtering the page. A
  "Filtered: N accounts" line with a Show all shortcut appears above the list,
  selected accounts are checked and highlighted, and the rest are muted.

## [2.57.0] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- Portfolio: a Futures card for users with a futures account. It lists each
  futures account's wallet balance, unrealized PnL and equity, and the net
  exposure per asset across all open positions (notional at mark; the five
  largest are shown and the rest fold into an expandable "Other" row).
  Unrealized PnL uses the same live prices and calculation as the terminal's
  Positions tab. Venues whose reported balance already includes unrealized PnL
  are not counted twice. The card is read-only and links to the terminal to
  manage positions.

## [2.56.6] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- DCA Analysis: a finished deal that filled more DCA orders than the bot is
  set to now (the bot's order count was lowered after the deal ran) is shown
  in its own "Finished Deals by DCA Count" bar and counts towards "Max DCAs"
  and "Avg DCAs" with its real number, instead of being folded into the bar
  for the bot's current order count. Its coverage is measured against the
  ladder it actually ran.

## [2.56.5] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- A chart whose candle request never answered stayed on "Loading chart..."
  forever, and none of its order, breakeven or fill lines were drawn:
  TradingView only reports the chart ready once the main series' history
  requests are answered. Every candle request now answers within 45 seconds,
  with an error if it has to, and the local candle cache can no longer hold
  one up: a cache read or write that does not finish within 5 seconds is
  skipped (a skipped read counts as a miss) instead of being waited on.
- A chart that is still not ready 30 seconds after it was created now shows
  "Chart failed to load." with a Retry button instead of spinning
  indefinitely. It also sends one diagnostic error report describing what
  the chart was still waiting on. If the chart's data did load and only the
  ready signal is missing, it finishes loading and draws its lines.

## [2.56.4] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- Kraken spot charts stopped updating live after a timeframe change (e.g. 1h
  to 1m). Kraken streams only one candle interval per pair on a connection,
  and the chart subscribes to the new timeframe before it drops the old one,
  so the new subscription was rejected and never retried. Each timeframe now
  streams on its own connection. Charts sharing a pair and timeframe share
  one subscription, so closing one no longer stops the others updating.

## [2.56.3] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- Kraken spot charts no longer replay the day's candles as live updates when
  a chart subscribes (on open, pair change or timeframe change). Kraken
  answers each subscription with a snapshot of recent candles, oldest first;
  all of them were forwarded to TradingView, which rejected every one older
  than its newest bar and logged a "time violation" console error for each.
  Only the forming candle is forwarded now, and candles of another interval
  on the shared socket are ignored. The chart datafeed also drops any
  realtime bar older than the newest bar the chart already has.

## [2.56.2] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- Trading page: bulk Stop never stopped anything and bulk Start re-sent
  Start to bots that were already running. Both now ask for confirmation
  (Stop offers the usual options for active deals) and send each bot's own
  type, so selected Combo and Grid bots are started and stopped correctly.
- Bot lists: bulk Delete no longer shows "Bot Name: N bots" and a placeholder
  "Last Activity", and its copy is pluralised.
- Bot lists: bulk Restart and Archive / Unarchive now ask for confirmation and
  say how many selected bots are skipped. Archive skips running bots instead of
  sending requests the server rejects.
- Closing several deals at once now shows the number of deals in the dialog.
  The bulk Cancel dialog in the deals widget uses plural wording.

## [2.56.1] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- Bulk Start/Stop confirmation on the DCA, Combo and Grid bot lists showed
  the bot count as if it were a bot's name ("stop \"1 bot\"") and did not
  mention selected bots that would be skipped. It now reads "Stop N bots" and
  says how many selected bots are already in that state.

## [2.56.0] - 2026-09-23

### Changed

- The DCA bot setting is now "Allow increasing orders to exchange minimum",
  off by default for new bots. With it off, a deal whose Base or Safety Order
  is below the pair's exchange minimum is not opened and you are notified.
  Bots created before this change have it on, so they keep increasing orders
  as before. Not shown for Hedge DCA or Combo bots. Requires main-app 2.97.0.

## [2.55.0] - 2026-09-23

### Added

- DCA bot setting "Reject Orders Below Exchange Minimum" (Strategy → advanced).
  When a Base or Safety Order is smaller than the pair's exchange minimum, the
  bot skips the deal on that pair and notifies you, instead of increasing the
  order to the minimum. Off by default. Requires main-app 2.96.0.

## [2.54.54] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- The indicator interval list for a Kraken spot bot now includes 3m, 2h and 8h.
  Kraken spot does not serve these widths directly, but the platform builds
  them from a shorter width Kraken does serve. The list was never updated to
  include them, so they could not be chosen. Kraken futures still offers only
  the widths its own candle feed provides.

## [2.54.53] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- The Portfolio Allocation widget showed "No portfolio data available" under an
  "All exchanges" title when its saved exchange selection was empty. An empty
  selection now shows the whole portfolio, the same as "All exchanges".
- The Portfolio Allocation widget's exchange filter is now available while the
  widget is loading or has nothing to show. Previously the filter area was an
  empty strip in those states, so a selection that showed nothing could not be
  changed from the widget.

## [2.54.52] - 2026-09-22

### Fixed

- The Deal History widget's per-deal "Add funds" and "Reduce funds" buttons now
  actually adjust the deal. Both opened a confirmation dialog whose confirm
  button re-ran the same handler with the same action, which only re-opened the
  dialog, so it stayed on screen and no order was ever placed — for every bot
  type. They now open the same funds dialog the deal card, the open-orders table
  and the bot drawer use, and are hidden on combo bots for the same reason those
  surfaces hide them.

### Removed

- The Deal History widget's per-deal "Edit" button. It had no edit flow behind
  it and shared the dialog loop above, so it could never do anything.

## [2.54.51] - 2026-09-22

### Fixed

- Combo bot deals no longer offer "Add Funds" / "Reduce Funds". Adjusting a
  deal's funds is a DCA capability — it resolves the bot among the DCA bots, so
  on a combo deal it could only ever answer "Bot not found" — and the bot
  drawer's deal list and the bulk deal actions already left it out. The deal
  card's menu and the deals table's row menu did not, so on the combo bots page
  and everywhere else they are used the action looked available and then failed
  once confirmed.

## [2.54.50] - 2026-09-22

### Fixed

- Keyboard-shortcut hints no longer appear on tablets. The "Next time, press
  ..." toast was suppressed only below 768px, so a tablet — which has no
  keyboard to press the shortcut on — still got the hint every time it used a
  button that has one. The hint is now held back for the whole phone and
  tablet range, and for a touch-only screen in landscape that is wider than
  that range; a touchscreen laptop still sees its hints.

## [2.54.49] - 2026-09-22

### Fixed

- Starting or stopping a combo, DCA or hedge bot no longer records a "Manual
  buy" entry in the bot's event log. The status toggle sent a manual-buy mode
  of "all" on every call, even though only grid bots act on one, so an
  ordinary Start or Stop was logged as a buy the user never made — including
  on the way down, where a stop appeared alongside "Buy type: all". The buy
  mode is now sent only for grid bots, or when the user actually picked one in
  the start dialog. The orders a bot places on restart are unaffected.

## [2.54.48] - 2026-09-22

### Fixed

- Searching the notifications panel no longer brings dismissed bot
  notifications back. The panel's default load asks for the unread bot feed,
  but as soon as the search box held a term — or a page past the first was
  requested — it asked for the full archive instead, so notifications that had
  already been marked as read reappeared in the results wearing the "New"
  chip, counted toward the unread badge, and offered a mark-as-read control
  that could never remove them. Every path now requests the same unread feed
  the default load does.
- "Mark all as read" on bot notifications no longer reports success when the
  backend rejected the request; the single-message action already checked.

## [2.54.47] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- The dashboard profit charts now name each day in the account's time zone
  rather than the browser's. Daily profit is bucketed by the account's calendar
  day, but the axis labels and tooltips were rendered in whatever zone the
  browser was in, so on a browser west of UTC every bar carried its day's
  profit under the previous day's name and disagreed with the Deals list
  filtered for that date. The 30-day window is now built from account calendar
  days too, so a day can no longer drop out of it when that zone changes
  offset. The same correction applies to the Accumulated profit widget — which
  additionally requested its series in UTC regardless of the account setting,
  drawing different day boundaries than the Profit widget beside it — and to
  the daily chart in the bot drawer, whose buckets were keyed by UTC day while
  its slots were named in the browser's.

## [2.54.46] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- Typing a letter while a dropdown is open no longer triggers a single-letter
  navigation shortcut. The global shortcuts stood down only for text fields, so
  in a picker — the Settings time zone list, for example — pressing `p` to reach
  a `Pacific/…` entry left the page for Portfolio instead, and the list's own
  type-ahead never ran because the keystroke was consumed before it arrived.
  Dropdowns, select menus and their triggers now keep the keys they use, and the
  shortcuts resume as soon as focus leaves the field.

## [2.54.45] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- The "Columns" menu on a table toolbar now sizes itself to the column names it
  lists, instead of sitting at a fixed 150px that cut longer names off mid-word
  with no ellipsis. Where several columns share a long prefix and differ only
  at the end — the market screener's price-change columns, which differ only by
  their trailing timeframe — the truncated rows read as the same string, so
  there was no way to tell which column a checkbox toggled. Menus whose names
  already fit are unchanged, and the menu never grows wider than the screen.

## [2.54.44] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- Settings → Time Zone is now chosen from the list of known time zones instead
  of typed in. Anything typed was previously saved as-is, and a spelling the
  app cannot recognise ("Chicago" rather than "America/Chicago") was then
  quietly ignored: every surface that keys off the account time zone — the
  overview Profit and Balance figures, table date columns, deal start
  schedules — fell back to the browser's zone while the field kept showing
  what had been typed, so there was no way to tell the setting was not in
  effect. An unrecognised zone that is already stored is now called out on the
  page, naming the zone actually in use and offering the browser's own as a
  one-click replacement, and it can no longer be re-saved by changing Week
  Start alone. A recognised zone that is already stored stays selectable even
  when it is an alias the bundled list does not spell out.

## [2.54.43] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- Date columns in tables now treat a day as the day in your account's time
  zone (Settings → Time Zone) rather than the one your browser happens to be
  in. That is the same boundary the Profit and Balance figures on the overview
  already use, so a deal is no longer counted on one day there and shown on
  another by the deals table — and filtering a date column for the day those
  figures put it on now returns it. Accounts that have not set a time
  zone, or stored one that cannot be recognised, are unaffected and keep using
  the browser's. Filtering a day that changes clocks covers the whole real
  day, whether it is 23, 24 or 25 hours long.

## [2.54.42] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- Coin icons no longer stretch into ovals when a row's text needs more room
  than the column gives it. The icon was a flex item that was allowed to
  shrink, so its width was compressed while its height stayed fixed; it now
  holds its size. Larger-than-default browser font sizes made this obvious,
  because the icon scales with the root font size while the column width does
  not.

## [2.54.41] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- The change-password form in Settings now lists the same password rules as
  the rest of the app, including the lowercase letter it never mentioned. It
  carried its own separate copy of the rules, so a password such as
  `PASSWORT123` showed a full set of green ticks and was still refused with
  "Password not valid". All three password forms now read from one rule set
  rather than each keeping their own.

## [2.54.40] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- The password rules shown while signing up or resetting a password now match
  the ones the server actually applies. The checklist asked for 6 characters
  and never mentioned a lowercase letter, while the reset endpoint requires 8
  and the change-password endpoint requires a lowercase letter — so a password
  such as `Haus12` could tick every rule on screen and still be refused on
  submit, with nothing on the form to explain why. The checklist is now the
  strictest of the three: 8 to 200 characters, with an uppercase letter, a
  lowercase letter and a digit. The case rules stay ASCII-only, matching the
  server, so an accented capital is not counted as an uppercase letter by one
  side and rejected by the other.

## [2.54.39] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- Filter a date column by a single day and get that day. The date filters take
  their value from a date picker, so what is chosen is always a calendar day,
  never a moment within it — but each operator compared the row's full
  timestamp against midnight of that day. `=` could therefore match nothing at
  all: no deal closes at exactly midnight, so picking a day on Close Time
  emptied the table. The rest of the set was skewed the same way — `≤ a day`
  dropped that whole day, `> a day` still returned rows from it (leaving it
  indistinguishable from `≥`), and a range of one day against itself spanned a
  zero-width instant and returned nothing. Every date operator now bounds the
  day as the column displays it: `=` anywhere inside it, `>` past its end, `<`
  before its start, `≥` from its start, `≤` to its end, and a range from the
  start of its first day to the end of its last. A range with one side still
  blank stays open-ended instead of emptying the table while it is being typed,
  and a row with no date is no longer returned by `<`.

## [2.54.38] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- Reject a grid take profit or stop loss price that every price in the grid's
  own range already satisfies. The two `priceReached` triggers are prices, and
  which side of the range each belongs on depends on the grid's direction: a
  long grid takes profit as the price rises and stops out as it falls, a short
  grid the other way round. Entered the wrong way round — a long grid's take
  profit at the bottom of its range, say — the trigger is true at every price
  the bot could trade at, so the bot stops on its first candle without filling
  a single level. There was nothing to see afterwards: a backtest of such a bot
  returns no results and no transactions, which reads as a backtest that
  failed rather than a bot that did exactly what it was configured to do. The
  form now names the problem while the bot is being set up. A trigger placed
  inside the range is still allowed — ending early is a legitimate choice, and
  only the always-true case is refused.

## [2.54.37] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- Stop the bot editor showing a trading pair a bot was never configured with.
  When a bot's saved pair list came back empty against the exchange's current
  listings, the form substituted a default pair from that venue — helpful while
  creating a bot, where the exchange is still being chosen, but in the editor it
  presented an invented contract as if it were the bot's own setting. The editor
  now shows no pair when the bot has none.
- Let a single-pair bot whose saved pair was removed be given one back. The pair
  field is read-only when editing a single-pair bot, because a configured bot's
  pair cannot be changed. A bot left with no pair at all was caught by the same
  rule, so the one change that would make it able to trade again was the one
  change the form refused to offer. Such a bot now gets an editable pair field
  and its choice is sent on save; a bot that still has its pair is unaffected.

## [2.54.36] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- Let the grid bots and combo bots lists filter on several statuses at once.
  Their status column filtered as free text, so the only way to ask for two
  statuses was to add two conditions to the column — and conditions on one
  column are combined with AND, which no single bot can satisfy, so the table
  came back empty. Status is a closed set of values, and the column now filters
  like one: `Is any of` selects open and range together as a single condition,
  matching how the DCA bots list has always behaved.

## [2.54.35] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- Tell the chat what the server decided about a confirmation it answered. The
  assistant's confirmation cards were answered optimistically — the card
  changed state on the click — but the backend refuses an answer that arrives
  after the confirmation window has closed, and said so only on socket events
  nothing subscribed to. A late answer therefore vanished without a word while
  the card claimed it had gone through and nothing ran. The two verdict events
  are relayed to subscribers, and the card now carries the deadline the
  backend stops waiting at, so it can retire its buttons instead of offering
  one that is discarded on arrival.

## [2.54.34] - 2026-09-20

### Fixed

- Let a pasted symbol land in the pair picker's search box. The box claimed
  every paste for the bulk "add several pairs" feature, so pasting a single
  symbol left the field unchanged and the list unfiltered — which made the
  clipboard useless for finding a pair, and that is the only practical way in
  when the ticker is not on your keyboard. Only a paste carrying more than one
  symbol is treated as a bulk add now. Bulk add is also no longer offered in
  the single-pair "Change pair" dialog, where the one-pair limit meant it could
  never add anything and could only answer that the maximum had been reached —
  and a message from a paste made in the picker is now shown in the picker,
  instead of on the form behind it where the open dialog covered it.

## [2.54.33] - 2026-09-20

### Fixed

- Show the bot drawer's DCA Analysis — deviation covered, averaging power,
  total funds and the projected order table — using the current value of any
  global variable the bot's settings are bound to. It was built from the
  literal each field held before it was bound, so a bound bot reported capital
  and coverage figures no deal on it would ever have. The same figures in the
  read-only view of a bot's settings are fixed with it, and they now follow a
  rebind without a reload.

## [2.54.32] - 2026-09-20

### Fixed

- Stop offering "Hide column" in a table's column header menu on tables that
  have no Columns dropdown. That dropdown — and the Reset Table item nested
  inside it — is the only way to bring a hidden column back, so on those tables
  hiding a column was a one-way door and it persisted across reloads. A column
  already hidden this way is shown again on the next load. The Orders table in
  a deal's details is the one users could walk into.

## [2.54.31] - 2026-09-20

### Fixed

- Resolve a global-variable binding made directly on a bot setting — base
  order size, DCA order size, take profit, minimum take profit and the like.
  Only bindings inside the indicator, custom DCA and multi take-profit /
  stop-loss lists were being resolved, so the projected order ladder and the
  funds, coverage and chart levels derived from it were built from the literal
  the binding had superseded instead of the variable's value.
- Keep a deal's own settings ahead of the variable's current value in that
  projection. A deal is sized from the snapshot taken when it opened, so
  editing a variable applies to new deals only.

## [2.54.30] - 2026-09-20

### Fixed

- Stop the column header menu from offering "Hide column" on tables that do
  not expose the Columns dropdown. That dropdown — which also holds Reset
  Table — is the only way to bring a hidden column back, so on those tables
  hiding one was permanent: the choice is saved per table and survived
  reloads with nothing in the interface able to undo it. Those tables now
  also ignore a column-visibility preference saved by an earlier build, so a
  column already lost this way comes back on the next load.

## [2.54.29] - 2026-09-20

### Fixed

- Restore the dashboard build. The data-table column filter anchors its
  multi-select dropdown to the whole filter cell through a virtual anchor,
  but handed the positioning library a cell reference that is empty until
  the cell is attached — which that library's type does not permit. The
  type check that gates the build rejected it, so the build stopped before
  bundling. The anchor is now built from the cell element once it exists;
  the dropdown still spans the column exactly as before.

## [2.54.28] - 2026-09-20

### Fixed

- The deal's Orders table no longer offers "Execute now" beside an order that
  has already executed. The action belongs to the next resting safety order,
  but it was matched to a row by id alone using a column set the Completed tab
  shares with Pending, so an order that reached the section twice lit the
  button on its own 100%-filled row. It is now offered only on the Pending tab
  and only on a level that is still working.
- An order could be listed twice, once as still resting and once as executed.
  Live and executed orders are held separately and were combined without
  matching them up, so replaying a cached fetch after a fill left a stale copy
  behind: a level that had already filled kept a phantom entry on the deal's
  order list and a phantom line on its chart for the rest of the session.
- The `TIME` column of a deal's Orders table now shows when each order
  executed rather than when it was placed. A resting limit order — every DCA
  safety order and every take profit — fills long after it is placed, so the
  column disagreed with the marker the same order has on the deal's chart.
  Placement time is still shown as "Created" when a row is expanded.

## [2.54.27] - 2026-09-20

### Fixed

- The Symbol filter's dropdown on the deals tables now opens across the width
  of the column instead of squeezing into the gap beside the values already
  chosen. The list took its width and position from the small text field left
  over to the right of the selected chips, so each further selection shrank it
  — at two symbols it was a sliver a couple of characters wide, and the column
  had to be dragged wider to read the options at all. It is now measured and
  aligned against the whole filter cell and will not render narrower than a
  legible minimum. The chips still absorb the shrinking rather than the field,
  so they stay readable in a narrow column.

## [2.54.26] - 2026-09-19

### Fixed

- Picking a symbol in the Symbol filter on the deals tables now returns that
  symbol and nothing else. Every selected value was matched as a substring, so
  choosing a short ticker also returned any longer symbol containing it —
  `AKE-USD` also brought back `CAKE-USD`, and `BTC/USDT` also brought back
  `WBTC/USDT` — with nothing in the table to show why. "Is none of" is the
  inverse of the same test and so silently hid those rows instead. A value
  chosen from the dropdown is now compared exactly against the symbol the row
  actually holds; a term typed by hand still matches loosely — against the
  pair, the base and quote assets and the unslashed symbol — as before. Columns
  that do not offer a fixed list of choices are unchanged.

## [2.54.25] - 2026-09-19

### Fixed

- The Symbol filter on the deals tables now offers one entry per symbol in the
  table, and its search box searches all of them. The dropdown was built from
  the column's search-matching helper, which deliberately returns several
  strings per row — the symbol, the pair, the base asset, the quote asset — so
  a table of N symbols produced roughly 3N entries, most of them bare assets
  rather than anything the column holds. That list was then sorted and cut to
  its first 100 entries, and the search box filtered the cut list rather than
  the full one, so a symbol sorting past the cut point could be reached neither
  by scrolling nor by typing. Options now come from a dedicated accessor, the
  cut applies only to how many rows are drawn at once (with a "keep typing to
  narrow" hint when more match), and typing always searches every option.
- Deal rows derived the base leg of their display pair by deleting the quote
  asset from the symbol as a substring, which left the separator behind on
  venues whose symbols are hyphenated: `ABC-USD` became `ABC-/USD`. The base
  asset reported alongside the symbol is used instead, falling back to the
  shared pair-splitting helper.

## [2.54.24] - 2026-09-18

### Fixed

- Bot settings bound to a global variable at the top level of the bot — base
  order size, DCA order amount, take profit, minimum take profit, price step
  and the rest — are now resolved before any projection is computed. Only
  bindings on indicators, custom DCA levels and multi take-profit/stop-loss
  targets were resolved; a binding on a plain setting was skipped, so the
  projected ladder and the figures derived from it were built from the literal
  the bot document still carries rather than the variable's value the engine
  spends. A running deal keeps sizing from the values it froze when it opened,
  so those are applied over the resolved settings, in the same order the engine
  aggregates them — moving a variable changes new deals, not open ones.

## [2.54.23] - 2026-09-18

### Fixed

- Projected DCA levels now follow the bot's global variables. A setting that is
  bound to a global variable keeps its superseded literal in the bot's own
  document, and the client-side ladder — the grey projected levels on a deal's
  chart, and the figures the "Execute next DCA" confirmation quotes — was built
  from those literals instead of from the variables' current values. A bot whose
  safety-order size or minimum-% distance is driven by a variable was therefore
  shown a budget and rungs its engine would not use. The bindings are now
  resolved before the ladder is computed, and the resolved settings are what the
  projection reports.
- Amounts in the "Execute next DCA" confirmation are shown in units of the
  asset. A quantity below 0.01 was rendered in scientific notation
  (`3.70e-3 BTC`), which cannot be compared against an exchange screen; it now
  reads `0.00407 BTC`. Prices keep their compact form.

## [2.54.22] - 2026-09-18

### Fixed

- Table filters now survive leaving the page and coming back. A table mirrors
  its filters into a `filters_<table>` link parameter so that a reload or a
  shared link restores them, but that mirror is written on a short delay and the
  delay is cancelled by the very navigation that leaves the page — so the last
  change made before leaving never reached it. Every later mount read the mirror
  back and saved it, overwriting the real filters with an older copy of
  themselves and deleting outright any column the link did not mention. The link
  is now read once, on the page load it arrives with, and a column it does not
  mention keeps its saved filter.

## [2.54.21] - 2026-09-18

### Fixed

- "Execute next DCA" now quotes the order the bot will actually send. A safety
  order sized in the quote currency spends its configured order size whatever
  the price does — the quantity floats — but the confirmation took the quantity
  the level was drawn with, at its own ladder price, and then priced that at the
  current market, counting the price move twice. On a deal whose ladder sits far
  from today's price the amount, the estimated cost and the projected new
  average were all overstated. For an indicator-triggered deal the level after
  it is now stated as the budget it will still spend, rather than as a quantity
  at a trigger price that condition never uses.

## [2.54.20] - 2026-09-18

### Fixed

- Changing a running deal's take-profit percentage keeps it a percentage of the
  deal's average price. It was being stored as the fixed price that percentage
  resolved to at that moment, so each further safety order moved the average
  while the close order stayed put and the percentage read back higher every
  time. Setting a take-profit by price — typing it, dragging the chart line or
  picking it — still pins that price, and the trading terminal is unchanged.

## [2.54.19] - 2026-09-18

### Fixed

- A running deal on an indicator-DCA bot now shows the safety-order sizes and
  distances it will actually use. After a bot's indicator order sizes were
  changed, the deal view projected the next safety order at the size meant for
  new deals. Needs the matching backend release.

## [2.54.18] - 2026-09-18

### Fixed

- Watchlist rows for Binance USD-M pairs sat on "Connecting..." forever while
  rows for other venues in the same widget updated normally. The widget dialled
  a Binance USD-M address that accepts a subscription but never sends any
  market data, so no price could ever arrive and nothing reported an error. It
  now uses the same USD-M feed the chart streams from.

## [2.54.17] - 2026-09-18

### Fixed

- Deal lists could keep showing a deal as open after it had closed. The lists
  are updated live, so a deal that closed while the connection was down, the
  computer was asleep or the tab was in the background stayed listed until
  the page was reloaded, and its Close button kept failing. Deal lists now
  refresh when the live connection comes back and when you return to a tab
  that has been in the background for more than 30 seconds.
- Closing or canceling a deal that has already finished now says so ("This
  deal had already closed") and removes it from the list, instead of
  reporting "Failed to close deal" and leaving it there to be tried again.

## [2.54.16] - 2026-09-17

### Fixed

- Quick Setup's risk profiles always fell back to default values on
  Hyperliquid builder-deployed (HIP-3) markets such as `xyz:GOLD-USDC`,
  because the past year of daily candles was requested under the upper-cased
  symbol, which the exchange does not recognise. The request now uses the
  market's native symbol, as backtests do since 2.54.15.

## [2.54.15] - 2026-09-17

### Fixed

- Bot backtests on Hyperliquid builder-deployed (HIP-3) markets such as
  `xyz:EUR-USDC` always returned 0 deals. The backtester asked for the pair's
  candles in upper case, and the exchange only recognises these markets under
  their exact native symbol, so no candles loaded and nothing could trade. The
  chart was unaffected because it already used the native symbol. Backtests
  now request candles under the native symbol too; every other pair is
  requested exactly as before.

## [2.54.14] - 2026-09-15

### Fixed

- A "greater than" or "less than" indicator condition shaded only as far as
  the indicator's nominal range instead of continuing past it. Because
  Bollinger Bands %B drops below 0 whenever price closes under the lower
  band, a condition such as "less than 0.05" left most of the bars it selects
  outside the shaded region; at the other end, ATR and ADR are quoted in
  price units and run well above 100, so a "greater than" condition on them
  produced an empty or inverted band. The shading now continues past the
  level without limit, matching the legacy dashboard. Conditions were always
  evaluated against the real values; only the drawing was affected.

## [2.54.13] - 2026-09-15

### Fixed

- The chart ignored an indicator's threshold levels unless the indicator was
  one of fifteen listed types. On Bollinger Bands %B, Keltner Channel %B,
  Bollinger Bands Width Percentile, ATR and ADR a condition such as
  "crosses up 0.03" drew no level line at all, and a range condition such as
  "less than 0.05" shaded the study's full default range instead of the range
  the condition actually names. The threshold now follows the condition for
  every study, as it does in the legacy dashboard; price overlays still show
  no threshold lines.

## [2.54.12] - 2026-09-15

### Fixed

- Backtests could run with a 0% exchange fee while the backtest settings showed
  the real fee. Loading a bot's settings into the edit form reset the fee that
  had already been looked up for the account, and the lookup does not repeat
  for the same pair, so it stayed empty for the rest of the session. The
  quick "Run backtest" button then fell back to 0%; runs started from the
  settings dialog used the fee shown there and were unaffected, which is why
  identical-looking settings could give very different results. The form now
  keeps the looked-up fee across reloads. Quick runs also use the fee of the
  last run from the settings dialog, and a backtest whose fee is unknown no
  longer runs as 0% — the settings dialog opens instead, with the fee field
  empty. Hedge bots' quick run, which always ran at 0%, now uses the fee as
  well.

## [2.54.11] - 2026-09-15

### Fixed

- Bollinger Bands %B and Keltner Channel %B were drawn on top of the candles
  instead of in their own pane below the chart. Both plot a unitless 0–1
  ratio rather than a price, so the chart showed two unrelated vertical
  scales at once and the indicator line ran through the price series. They
  were flagged as price overlays alongside Bollinger Bands and Keltner
  Channel themselves, which overrode the studies' own declaration that they
  are not price studies. Both now get their own pane, as the other
  oscillators do.

## [2.54.10] - 2026-09-14

### Fixed

- "Change DCA levels" failed on an open deal for every level count except 0.
  The dialog sent the new count as text while the API declares it as a whole
  number, so the request was rejected before it reached the deal — nothing was
  changed either way, and the only value that worked was 0, which takes a
  different branch and simply turns further DCA orders off. The deal-edit
  mutations now convert the order-count fields where they build the request,
  so every entry point is fixed together: the dialog in the deal card, the
  deals table in the bot drawer, the open-orders widget, and the Edit Deal
  drawer, which sent the same count as text when saving a single deal.

## [2.54.9] - 2026-09-14

### Fixed

- The "Execute next DCA" confirmation still showed no amount, estimated cost
  or average price when opened from the deals list, and on bots that don't
  rest their safety orders on the exchange — DCA by market and DCA triggered
  by indicators. It was sizing the level from the bot settings carried on the
  deal, which the deals list only fetches in part. It now reads the bot's full
  settings and picks the level by its position in the ladder, the same way the
  bot does, so figures appear on every eligible deal and a deal that has
  already bought some levels at market is never quoted an earlier level again.
- A pending limit "Add funds" order is no longer mistaken for the next DCA
  level in that confirmation.

## [2.54.7] - 2026-09-14

### Fixed

- A bot's Performance chart no longer stretches its time axis back to 1969.
  A daily chart point stored with an invalid date was plotted as the series'
  first point, so under the default "All" range the real history was squeezed
  into a thin sliver at the right edge. Points dated before 2001 are now
  ignored by both bot performance charts.

## [2.54.6] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- Quick Setup's Investment field can be typed into again. The figure was
  re-derived from the per-order sizes it had been split into and written back
  over the text as you typed, so a keystroke landed on a number you had not
  entered and the field settled on something else entirely.
- Quick Setup now funds a bot with the investment you asked for. The base
  order and every safety order were given the same rounded share, which
  restricted the reachable total to multiples of the whole ladder — the base
  order now carries the remainder, so the total matches what you set and the
  investment slider deploys the share of your balance it reports.

## [2.54.5] - 2026-09-12

### Added

- Saved bot templates are now reachable from the bot form itself: the save-row
  options menu lists them under "Load template", next to "Save as template".
  Previously the only ways back to a template were the Quick Setup picker —
  which also reapplies a risk profile on top of your settings — and a hotkey
  you had to assign while saving, so a template saved from Manual mode looked
  like it had never been saved.

### Changed

- Saving a bot template now confirms with a message naming the template and
  where to reopen it, and both template dialogs state that templates are kept
  in the current browser.

## [2.54.4] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- Editing a take profit or stop loss on an open SHORT deal no longer computes
  the target price in the long direction. The Edit Deal form never carried the
  deal's direction, so it fell back to long: typing a take profit percentage on
  a short deal produced a price ABOVE the breakeven instead of below it, and
  saving stored that price as the deal's fixed take profit. Long deals are
  unaffected.

## [2.54.3] - 2026-09-11

### Changed

- Cross-margin futures bots no longer show an estimated liquidation price.
  Cross margin liquidates against the whole wallet — free balance and every
  other open position — so the estimate, which counted only the bot's own
  margin, printed a figure much closer than the real one along with a risk
  rating and cascade warning derived from it. The Margin & Leverage section
  now shows a short note instead, and the liquidation line is no longer drawn
  on the bot chart, the deal chart or the order ladder graph. Isolated margin
  is unchanged.

## [2.54.2] - 2026-09-11

### Fixed

- A take profit, safety order or grid level that rested on the order book before
  filling was drawn on the chart at the moment it was placed, not the moment it
  filled, so a sell could appear on a candle that never traded at its price.
  Chart buy and sell markers now sit on the fill for orders that filled their
  whole size; an order that only partly filled keeps its placement time, because
  its last update is the later cancel of the unfilled remainder.

## [2.54.1] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- Settings no longer fails to open for anyone who had used the page before.
  Notification preferences are stored in the browser, and a stored copy written
  before a notification type existed did not contain it; the page then read
  through a missing entry while drawing that row and stopped rendering. Stored
  preferences are now merged with the current set, so a newly added type arrives
  with its default and existing choices are kept, and a missing entry can no
  longer break the page.

## [2.54.0] - 2026-09-10

### Added

- Settings → Notifications has a new "Safety Order Filled" row, so a DCA bot
  can tell you over Telegram each time one of its safety orders fills and which
  one it was. It sits with the other order-fill rows, is off by default, and
  offers no Email column — a deal fills one of these per level, so an email per
  fill would be a mailbox flood.
- A Template column on the same table lets you rewrite the wording of any
  notification, in Markdown — `**bold**`, `*italic*`, `` `code` ``,
  `[text](url)`, `||spoiler||`, and a new line where you type one. The editor
  previews the message with the same renderer the notes widget uses, lists the
  variables you can use, and flags a variable that does not exist. Nothing else
  can be got wrong: anything that is not Markdown is shown exactly as typed, so
  a template can never break a notification. Anything you leave alone keeps the
  maintained default, so wording you never changed keeps improving.

## [2.53.10] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- The "Execute next DCA" confirmation now always shows the order's size, its
  estimated cost and where the deal's average price lands. It read those from
  an order resting on the exchange, so it showed none of them on bots that
  never rest their safety orders — DCA-by-market bots and bots whose DCA is
  triggered by indicators — leaving the confirmation with no figures at all.
  It now falls back to the same projected ladder the deal chart draws.

### Added

- The same confirmation now names the level that comes *after* the one being
  executed, with its price and size, so it is visible that executing early
  does not move the levels below: every level is worked out from the deal's
  opening price and the bot's settings, not from where an earlier one filled.

## [2.53.9] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- Portfolio balances: with "Aggregate" on and one or more accounts selected,
  every token held on more than one exchange disappeared from the table while
  tokens held on a single exchange stayed. Aggregating sums a token across
  venues, so the summed row can no longer name one and its exchange field is
  blank — and the table then filtered those rows out by that same blank field.
  The selection is now applied before the sum, so the totals mean "across the
  selected accounts" and nothing is dropped afterwards.

## [2.53.8] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed

- The take-profit "Close order type" now shows the value the bot actually has.
  It was never requested when a bot's settings were loaded, so the form fell
  back to its Limit default no matter what was stored, and — because the
  setting is written on every save — the next save persisted that default over
  the user's choice. Combo bots were affected silently, having no control for
  it, and a deal's own override is now shown in the deal editor.

## [2.53.7] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed

- The bot details panel can now be expanded to full screen from every tab. The
  Deals, Stats, Events and Settings tabs rendered no expand control at all — on
  a touch device, where there is no hover and no triple-click, that left their
  content permanently confined to the panel's width, the deals table worst of
  all. Overview and Webhook already had it, and are unchanged.

## [2.53.6] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed

- The deal chart no longer draws a stop-loss line for a stop the bot engine
  will not act on. When a deal's stop loss closes on an external signal
  (webhook or indicator condition) rather than on price, the stop-loss
  percentage is not a price level — it only becomes one after Move SL fires
  and replaces it. The chart drew it anyway, showing a stop far below the
  entry that nothing would ever execute. The Move stop loss trigger line is
  unchanged, and the moved stop still appears once Move SL has fired.

## [2.53.5] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed

- Adaptive Close is no longer offered on futures bots. The setting re-sizes a
  closing order the exchange refused for lack of funds down to the amount of
  the traded coin held in the wallet, which is only a meaningful quantity on a
  spot account — a futures wallet holds collateral rather than the coin. The
  engine now applies it to spot bots only, but the toggle was shown on every
  DCA and combo bot regardless, so a futures bot could switch on a setting
  that could never take effect. Spot bots are unchanged.

## [2.53.4] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- Widgets: on touch devices the expand/full-screen control is now visible as
  soon as the widget is, on both dashboard widgets and the bot details
  drawer. It was previously drawn only while a finger was on the widget and
  hidden again a few seconds later, so on a tablet there was nothing on
  screen to indicate the control existed. Behaviour on devices with a mouse
  is unchanged — the controls still appear on hover.

## [2.53.3] - 2026-09-08

### Added

- DCA and combo deal queries now request `feeByAsset` (per-asset fee
  breakdown) alongside the existing `feePaid` field, matching the field
  app-sh now records. Not surfaced in any view yet — data plumbing only.

## [2.53.2] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- Tables: a column switched on from the Columns menu could not be moved until
  the page was left and reopened, and dragging any column reset the saved
  position of every column that was switched off. A drag now reads the column
  layout as it is actually rendered at that moment, and puts hidden columns
  back beside the column they were left next to.
- Bot form: the credits chip could quote a fractional cost slightly above the
  whole number of credits a bot is actually charged, when extra pairs put the
  cost on a half credit. It now shows the charged figure; the hover breakdown
  still itemises the unrounded parts.

## [2.53.1] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- Subscription: the Active Bots breakdown counted zero live bots for accounts
  with no paper bots (and vice versa). The panel loads both trading contexts at
  once, and each list replaced the other's cached bots as it arrived, so the
  empty context wiped the populated one. A list pinned to a context other than
  the one currently selected now reads its own result and leaves the shared
  cache alone.

## [2.53.0] - 2026-09-07

### Added

- Execute a DCA deal's next safety order on demand, at market, instead of
  waiting for price to reach it. The action sits on the deal actions menu
  (deals list, bot drawer and open-orders widget) and inline on the deal's
  own ladder, on the one row it applies to — the next unfilled safety order.
  A confirmation shows the level's ladder price against the current market
  price, the size and cost, how far from the ladder the fill would be, and
  where the deal's average moves to; it is withheld on combo and risk-based
  deals, whose levels are not ladder slots.

## [2.52.5] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- A bot's own Deals tab no longer stops at 500 trades. Opening a bot and
  switching its deals to Closed loaded at most 500 rows however many the bot
  had — the footer even said "500 of 1,000" — so older deals were reachable
  only through the CSV export. The tab now loads every deal the server reports.

## [2.52.4] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- Trading Bots → Deals no longer stops at 500 trades. The Closed view fetched a
  single page and reported that page's length as the total, so an account with
  more than 500 closed deals always read "Closed (500)" and could not reach
  anything older than the newest 500. The list now pages until the server's own
  count is reached.

## [2.52.3] - 2026-09-06

### Fixed

- Widgets can be opened full-screen on a tablet again. A tablet is wide enough
  to get the desktop layout but cannot hover, so the widget controls were
  hidden with no way to reveal them, leaving a fast triple-tap as the only
  route into full-screen. The controls now appear on touch.
- Bot details drawer panels (Basic, Profit, Performance, ...) now carry their
  own expand button, so they can be opened full-screen directly instead of only
  by triple-tapping the panel.
- The full-screen header no longer auto-hides on a touch device, where nothing
  could bring it back — that left no reachable Exit button whenever the
  widget's content was too short to scroll.

## [2.52.2] - 2026-09-06

### Fixed

- Grid bots table: the Drawdown column was coloured and read as a gain — a 9%
  drawdown showed as a green 9.06%. It is now shown in the loss colour, like
  drawdown everywhere else in the app. Drawdown and Run Up can also be sorted
  and filtered again; both columns previously ignored sorting and showed no
  filter input.
- Chart trade markers were placed at the order's update time instead of the
  fill time.

## [2.52.1] - 2026-09-06

### Fixed

- Column filters returned no results on several tables. Filtering the Portfolio
  TOKEN column for a coin you hold, or the Symbol, Side, Status, Type, Bot, Bot
  Type, Coin, Exchange, Category or Strategy columns on Portfolio Balances,
  Latest Orders, Edit Orders, the Market Screener and the curated presets list,
  silently matched nothing. Those columns now filter as expected.

## [2.52.0] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- Estimated liquidation price for leveraged DCA and Combo bots, in four places:
  a dashed line on the price chart, a line on the DCA ladder graph, two columns
  on the ladder table (the liquidation price after each safety order fills and
  how far that order sits from it), and a readout under Margin & Leverage. The
  readout also warns about a cascade — a safety order whose fill would push
  liquidation past the trigger of the next one, so the ladder liquidates before
  it finishes deploying. The line is shown when viewing and editing an open
  deal too, measured from the position the deal already holds.

  The figure is an estimate and labelled as one: exchanges do not expose their
  maintenance-margin tiers to us, so a 0.5% rate is assumed, and funding and
  fees are excluded. Cross-margin positions are additionally backed by the free
  wallet balance, so their real liquidation sits further away than shown.

### Fixed

- An order line with no quantity no longer draws an unreadable solid block on
  the chart where the quantity chip would be.
## [2.51.8] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- Short deals opened from the Trading Terminal drew their stop loss BELOW the
  entry price — inside the profit zone — instead of above it, and their trailing
  take-profit start above the entry instead of below. The chart was reading the
  deal's direction from a field a terminal deal never carries and falling back to
  "long", so every engine-managed exit line came out mirrored. The bot itself was
  always stopping out on the correct side; only the chart was wrong.

## [2.51.7] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- Take-profit targets that have already executed are now shown as executed when
  you edit an open deal. A multi-target deal used to keep listing a target it
  had already taken as an ordinary, editable row — often with a nonsensical
  negative percentage, because taking the target moves the deal's breakeven
  underneath it. Filled targets are now labelled "Filled" and locked, and they
  no longer set the minimum distance for the targets that are still live, so
  lowering a remaining target is no longer silently raised to a value above the
  market (where it would never trigger).

## [2.51.6] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- The per-pair table at the bottom of a bot's Statistics tab no longer goes
  missing. On a busy multi-pair bot the tab could open with every other block
  present but no Pairs breakdown at all, because a live stats update from the
  bot made the tab skip fetching the per-pair rows. Live updates now carry the
  per-pair figures too, so the table also refreshes as deals close.

## [2.51.5] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- Table search boxes now match the text you actually typed. Searching the
  Deals table for `sui` no longer returns SUSHI, and `near` no longer returns
  practically every deal — the search used to match your letters scattered
  anywhere in a row, including in columns you had hidden (a `1%` take-profit
  config was enough to match `near`). Applies to every table with a search box.

## [2.51.4] - 2026-09-03

### Added

- Stale-balance marker on the portfolio balances widget: a clock next to any asset whose backend balance row is older than 15 minutes, with the last-fetched time and a one-click REST refresh for that venue (or all venues for a summed asset). Reads the new `getBalances.updated` field (main-app core ≥ 1.57.1); older backends show no marker.

## [2.51.3] - 2026-09-03

### Added

- Grid bots get an **Unrealized PnL** column and hedge bots get a **Net
  PnL** column, so all five bot lists now decompose profit the same way:
  Realized + Unrealized = Net.
- The bot drawer, the bot-list stat boxes, the dashboard KPIs and the grid
  data page explain every figure on hover, the way the list columns already
  do.

### Changed

- One vocabulary everywhere a bot's money is shown, not just in the lists:
  the drawer, the grid Funds Overview ("Total P&L" → Net PnL), the
  Performance and Profit Analysis widgets, the per-list stat boxes ("Total
  P&L" → Realized PnL) and the dashboard KPIs ("uPnL" → Unrealized PnL,
  "Total profit" → Realized PnL).
- The drawer's Performance Analysis widget showed a figure labelled "Total
  Profit" and captioned "Realized + Unrealized" that was neither — it is the
  bot's realized profit. It now says Realized PnL, beside its Unrealized and
  Net counterparts.
- Unrealized PnL is no longer repeated in the drawer's Current Positions
  section; it sits once, next to the realized and net figures it decomposes.

### Fixed

- A grid bot's Net PnL read as NaN, and sorted as text, once it passed
  $10,000. The figure was formatted for display ("12.3K") before anything
  numeric consumed it.
- The grid **Realized PnL** column paired a total-profit dollar figure with
  a free-profit percentage, so the percentage under-reported the amount
  printed beside it on any running bot holding unreleased profit.

## [2.51.2] - 2026-09-03

### Changed

- The bot lists now name their money columns the same way on every bot type:
  **Realized PnL** (closed deals only), **Unrealized PnL** (what is still
  open) and **Net PnL** (the two added together). This retires "Total
  profit", the DCA/Combo "Value" column — which held unrealized PnL, not a
  value — and the grid "Value change" column, which was already Net PnL
  under another name. The grid bot's own worth is now "Current value".
  Numbers, sorting and filtering are unchanged; only the labels moved.
- Card view follows the same names as the table it belongs to.

### Added

- Every column in the DCA, Combo, Grid and Hedge bot lists explains itself
  on hover: what the number is made of, and what its percentage divides by.
  The three PnL percentages deliberately use different denominators (max
  cost, current cost, initial balance) and each now says which.

## [2.51.1] - 2026-09-03

### Added

- Quick Setup now offers the same three-way **Position side** as the full
  form when the grid runs on a futures exchange: Long, Neutral or Short.

### Fixed

- A futures grid created from Quick Setup now trades the side that was
  picked. Quick Setup wrote the spot direction field, which the engine only
  reads as a fallback, so the bot ran neutral regardless.
- The Risk Profile ranges now centre symmetrically around the current price
  for a Neutral futures grid, instead of tilting to one side as they do for
  Long and Short.

## [2.51.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added

- Grid bots on a futures exchange now offer the full three-way **Position
  side** — Long, Neutral or Short — instead of only Long/Short. Neutral opens
  no position at the start and works the grid from flat, matching the option
  the previous dashboard offered.

### Fixed

- A futures grid bot's direction now actually reaches the bot. The control was
  writing the spot `strategy` field, which the engine only consults as a
  fallback, so every futures grid was created Neutral no matter which side was
  picked.
- Direction / Position side is no longer clickable when editing an existing
  grid bot. It is fixed at creation and the change was silently dropped on
  save.

## [2.50.27] - 2026-09-03

### Fixed

- Notifications panel: an already-read Update or News item no longer shows a
  "Mark as read" button that does nothing. Read items are now dimmed and
  carry a "Read" marker, so it is clear there is nothing left to clear.
  Previously every card offered that button regardless of read state, which
  made a fully-read Updates tab look permanently unclearable.

## [2.50.26] - 2026-09-02

### Added

- Connecting an exchange now ends in a success moment instead of the dialog
  silently closing: a confetti celebration names the account(s) that were
  created (an "All" provider creates several) and offers a "Create a bot"
  button that opens the bot wizard, with the new account preselected in the
  form. Reached from the Exchanges page, the Portfolio page and
  /add-exchange.

## [2.50.25] - 2026-09-02

### Fixed

- The Deals table in the bot details drawer now offers proper filter operators
  on its numeric and date columns. Cost, Avg/Entry/Close Price, Size, Notional
  Value, Orders, Drawdown, Run Up, Transactions, Grid Profit and the P&L columns
  filter with Equals / Greater than / Less than / Between instead of substring
  matching, and Created, Update Time and Close Time filter with After / Before /
  Between. Previously only Usage was typed, so every other column matched filter
  text against the rendered value.
- Column filter operator menus now close when you open another one. In the bot
  details drawer they used to stack up, leaving one menu open per column.

## [2.50.24] - 2026-09-01

### Fixed

- Picking a single exchange in the Portfolio Balances widget now works on the
  Dashboards page. The widget treated "this page has no portfolio-wide exchange
  selection" as "the page selected All exchanges" and immediately reset your
  choice, so the Select Exchanges dialog appeared to do nothing. Cross-widget
  syncing on the Portfolio and Overview pages is unchanged.

## [2.50.23] - 2026-09-01

### Fixed

- Signing in via an emailed magic link now completes for accounts with
  two-factor authentication enabled: the link hands off to the standard 2FA
  code step instead of failing with "Sign-in failed — Cannot access". Requires
  main-app 2.87.17 (the consume mutation's new `isOTP` field).

## [2.50.22] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- **Add / Reduce funds shows what bounds the amount.** The field carries the
  balance it is capped by, with 25/50/75% shortcuts. The two directions are
  capped by different things and are resolved separately: an ADD is capped by
  the asset it spends — quote for a long, base for a short — converted into
  whatever unit is being typed, and withheld when no usable price exists to
  convert through. A REDUCE is capped by the position the deal holds. A bulk
  selection shows no figure, since several deals resolve differently.
- **"% of available" sizing on Add funds**, alongside "% of position". It is
  resolved in the dialog against the balance beside it and submitted as a fixed
  amount, because the engine has no percent-of-balance path — `addDealFunds`
  reads `asset === base` as a base quantity and everything else as quote, so a
  raw percentage would place a wildly different order. The dialog says the
  figure is pinned at confirm rather than re-read at execution.

### Fixed

- **Settings → Notification Preferences shows its Telegram and Email columns
  again.** They disappeared when the page moved into core: the extra channels
  became extension slots and the cloud build never registered a filler, so the
  table silently rendered Type / In-App / Sound — an unfilled slot renders
  nothing and reports nothing. Two further slots (`…channels.panel` and
  `…channels.actions`) let the channels bring their own account-link card and
  Save / Reset row. Self-hosted has no Telegram integration and leaves all four
  empty, as before.
- The deals-list query never selected `avgPrice`, so the percentage basis
  divided by zero, came back `Infinity`, and the guard turned that into "no
  basis at all". `dcaDealToOpenTrade` never attached `percentBasis` either,
  though `transformDealToTrade` always has. Between them, the "% of position"
  preview had never resolved for a deal opened from the trades list or the
  Hedge DCA deals tab.
- Add funds on a futures deal no longer shows a spot-wallet ceiling — in
  practice "BAL 0", since futures collateral sits in margin — and no longer
  offers "% of available". Both trade transforms now carry an explicit
  `futures` flag: `dealType` could not be used, because it means the market
  type in one mapper, the bot type in another, and "Hedge or not" in a third.
- `BalanceInput` rendered its stacked-layout row — a `border-t` with padding —
  even when the currency dropdown inside it was absent, leaving an empty
  bordered strip between the field and its percentage buttons.
- The funds amount field showed a generic `$` placeholder instead of the
  asset's own logo.

## [2.50.21] - 2026-09-01

### Fixed

- **A Moving Averages or Crossing Oscillator condition set to compare against a
  second series now actually crosses.** When the Reference was anything other
  than "Current price", the form never created the internal id that addresses
  that second moving average / oscillator, so neither the editor's backtest nor
  the running bot ever built it: the comparison value stayed at zero, no
  crossing could fire, and the backtest reported zero deals while both averages
  still drew correctly on the chart. Only the Bot controller section minted the
  id; deal start, take profit, stop loss, risk:reward, dynamic AR and the DCA
  ladder all left it out. It is now created for every indicator, and filled in
  on save for bots that were built without one.

## [2.50.20] - 2026-08-31

### Fixed

- **Editing an exchange connection now asks for the passphrase once the key or
  secret changes.** The field is blank on open and the placeholder said "leave
  blank to keep current" — advice that is correct for a rename and actively
  wrong for a key rotation, because a new API key comes with its own
  passphrase and the backend would otherwise pair the new key with the old one.
  The field becomes required, with a matching placeholder, exactly when the
  credentials it belongs to have been changed; a metadata-only edit still
  leaves it optional.

## [2.50.19] - 2026-08-31

### Fixed

- Grid bot form: pairs whose quote asset isn't one of the common tickers were parsed by chopping the last three characters off the symbol, so an OKX X-Perp pair (`ARB-USD_UM_XPERP`) came out as base `ARB-USD_UM_XP` / quote `ERP` and every field in the form — investment, range, balance — was labelled and funded in "ERP". The form now uses the app's shared pair resolver, which understands the X-Perp contract suffix (`ARB/USDC`), slash- and dash-separated symbols and the concatenated form.

## [2.50.18] - 2026-09-01

### Fixed

- Bots using indicators in the Bot Controller can be saved again. Saving failed
  with a server error for two reasons. Every Bot Controller indicator carried a
  hidden duplicate copy of its own settings that the server has no field for,
  which by itself broke any bot with a start condition — including a brand-new
  one. And when the controller was set to start *and* stop the bot on
  indicators, the start indicators were sent exactly as typed, so a length of
  "50" arrived as text where a number was expected and the "keep condition for
  N bars" setting arrived as a number where text was expected.

## [2.50.17] - 2026-08-31

### Fixed

- The Watchlist now opens each pair's chart on the exchange that pair was added
  from. Clicking a row told the chart the symbol but never the venue, so the
  chart guessed: it either drew candles from some other exchange that happens to
  list the same symbol, or — when none does — an empty Binance chart. A
  Bybit-linear HYPEUSDT row opened an empty "HYPE / USDT · BINANCE" chart, and
  in another layout charted Binance.US prices roughly 3% away from the price the
  row itself was showing.

## [2.50.16] - 2026-08-31

### Fixed

- The Profit widget no longer crashes the Overview page on browsers whose date
  parser cannot read back their own locale-formatted dates (seen on Chrome 110
  for Android). The daily chart worked out your timezone by formatting a date to
  text and parsing it back; where that round-trip failed the widget threw and
  took the whole landing page down with it. The timezone is now resolved without
  that round-trip, and one that still cannot be resolved falls back to UTC
  midnight rather than failing the page.
- Daily profit labels are no longer shifted by an hour on the two days a year
  your own device switches to or from daylight saving time. The same round-trip
  resolved the offset against the device's clock instead of your configured
  timezone, which moved the labels even for timezones that have no daylight
  saving at all.

## [2.50.15] - 2026-08-30

### Changed

- Crash reports now carry the form's configuration (bot type, mode, active tab,
  quick/manual setup, pair count, which fields were erroring) alongside the
  existing breadcrumb trail, so a crash that only reproduces with one specific
  setup can be diagnosed from the report instead of needing the user to
  reproduce it on request. Enum-like values only — no form values, names, or
  balances are captured.
- The render-loop tripwire, which records a component's changed-prop history
  just before an infinite-render crash, now also covers the bot form shell, the
  trading terminal's order entry panel, and every data table. It previously
  watched a single component. Still opt-out via
  `localStorage['gainium:tripwire'] = 'off'`.

## [2.50.14] - 2026-08-29

### Fixed

- A deal that ran for less than an hour no longer reports its Working Time as
  "0H". Deal working times are now shown to the minute (and to the second for
  very short deals), so a deal that ran 28 minutes reads "28m 26s" instead of
  claiming it never ran. Affects the Working Time column on every deal table,
  the deal cards, and the deal history on the bot edit page.

## [2.50.13] - 2026-08-29

### Added

- Trading Terminal → Exchange Orders → Positions now shows the mark price and
  the unrealized P&L over the whole position, as an amount in the quote asset
  and as a return on the margin posted. Computed from the entry price against
  the live ticker, so it works the same on every venue.
- A "Positions" entry under Terminal in the sidebar, opening the terminal
  straight on that table.

### Fixed

- Closing a position by market now actually leaves it flat. Adopting a position
  rounds the order to the exchange's step, so one pass could leave a fraction
  open, which then re-appeared as its own unowned row; the remainder is now
  closed out reduce-only.
- A bot sitting in an error state is no longer treated as dormant when warning
  that it will re-open a deal after the close — the error clears on the next
  cycle and the bot starts again.

### Changed

- Replaced the positions "Source" column with "Linked bots". A single exchange
  position can be shared by several bots — the exchange nets them into one —
  and the old column showed just one of them and attributed the entire position
  to it. It now lists every bot on the position, and a popover breaks the
  quantity down per bot with the part no bot holds shown separately.
- "Close by market" now flattens the whole position through Gainium: each
  linked bot closes its own deal, then the remainder is imported as a terminal
  deal and closed, so every part of the position lands in the deal history. It
  replaces both the old raw exchange close, which recorded nothing and left
  every linked bot thinking it still held a position, and the separate
  import-and-close action.
- The close confirmation now lists what is being closed per bot, offers to
  pause bots that start deals ASAP (they would otherwise re-open the position
  immediately), and warns when other orders are resting on the pair — closing a
  deal only cancels that deal's own orders, never everything on the symbol.
- Renamed the positions "Price" column to "Entry price", so it can't be read as
  the current price now that the mark price sits beside it.

## [2.50.12] - 2026-08-29

### Fixed

- A closed deal's "Working Time" kept counting up forever instead of stopping
  when the deal closed. Every finished deal reported how long ago it had
  started rather than how long it ran, and the number grew by another day every
  day — a deal that ran twelve minutes read "1D 4H". Affected the Working Time
  column on the Trading Bots → Deals list, the bot details drawer's deals
  table, the Trades page and the bot edit page's deal history, and the deal
  tables' Working Time sort, which ordered closed deals by age rather than by
  how long they ran. Open deals still count up to now.

## [2.50.11] - 2026-08-28

### Fixed

- Four more deal-table columns did not sort correctly, on the Trading Bots →
  Deals list (open and closed) and in the bot details drawer's deals table.
  "Grid Profit, %" did not sort at all. "Update Time" ordered deals by the text
  of the displayed date, so December 2025 landed between January and August
  2026. "Working Time" compared "3D 4H" with "4H" as text, ranking a three-day
  deal as shorter than a four-hour one. "Time In Loss" and "Time In Profit"
  compared percentages as text, ranking 12.3% below 9.5%. All of them now sort
  by the underlying value; the displayed text and the column filters are
  unchanged.

## [2.50.10] - 2026-08-28

### Fixed

- The "Realized P&L, %" column did not sort. Clicking its header on the
  Trading Bots → Deals list (open or closed) and in the bot details drawer's
  deals table left the rows in exactly the order they were already in, in both
  directions. Filtering that column by a number was silently ignored for the
  same reason. Sorting and filtering now use the percentage the column
  displays.

## [2.50.9] - 2026-08-28

### Fixed

- A custom link added to the sidebar showed the recent-bots pills underneath
  it whenever its URL started with a built-in bot page's path (e.g. a link to
  `/bots`). The link inherited the Trading Bots category and repeated that
  row's recent-bot shortcuts under itself. Custom links now never carry a
  recents drop-down; the built-in Trading / Grid / Combo / Hedge bot rows keep
  theirs.

## [2.50.8] - 2026-08-28

### Fixed

- The Usage ring on a DCA or Combo bot card was labelled with the bot's deal
  counts — the same "1 / 35" already printed under **Deals — Open / Total**
  further down the same card — so it read as "1 of 35 DCA orders" and said
  nothing about usage. It now shows the DCA ladder: filled / total orders
  across the bot's open deals, matching what the deal card and the deals table
  have always printed under their own Usage rings. A bot with no open deal is
  left unlabelled rather than reading `0/0`.
- The USAGE column in the DCA and Combo bots tables showed only a percentage,
  with no way to see how many safety orders had triggered. It now carries the
  same filled / total DCA orders label, and a tooltip spelling it out.

## [2.50.7] - 2026-08-28

### Fixed

- Editing a DCA deal failed outright. Every save — one deal or a bulk edit of
  many, and whatever was actually changed — came back as
  `Failed to edit deal: HTTP error! status: 400 … Field "gridLevel" is not
  defined by type "dcaDealSettingsInputSet"`, so open DCA deals could not have
  their take profit or stop loss turned off, or anything else adjusted.

  The deal-edit drawer decides what to send from one hand-written list of
  fields that is shared by both bot types. `gridLevel` is on it for the combo
  "DCA grid levels" control, but it is declared only on the combo mutation's
  input — and GraphQL rejects the whole operation over one undeclared field,
  rather than ignoring it. It was reasoned safe because the control is
  read-only while editing a deal, which holds for combo (where the value
  matches the bot's and so never counts as a change) but not for DCA, where
  nothing supplies the field at all and the drawer's own default therefore
  looked like an edit on every save. It is now sent for combo deals only.

  Combo deal edits were never affected.

## [2.50.6] - 2026-08-28

### Added

- Deals table and deal cards show a "Trailing TP" / "Trailing SL" marker under
  the status dot while the bot is riding a trailing exit, with the current
  trailing price on hover. Nothing said a deal was trailing before.
- The deal chart draws the exits the bot manages itself, which never rest as
  exchange orders and so were invisible: the live trailing take-profit /
  stop-loss level, the price trailing take profit starts at, the stop loss, and
  the price that triggers Move SL. A deal with trailing take profit on used to
  show only its breakeven line.

## [2.50.5] - 2026-08-28

### Changed

- Deal cards: the P/L range bar reads as a scale. "Worst" and "Best" sit above
  each end with their percentage beneath, and the live value is printed under
  the marker, centred on it.

## [2.50.4] - 2026-08-28

### Changed

- Deal cards: the P/L range bar under "Unrealized" now says what it is
  measuring. The two ends carry "Worst" / "Best" captions and the break-even
  hairline names the deal's average price on hover — previously it was two
  unlabelled percentages with nothing to read them against.
- Deal cards: clicking the Usage ring opens that deal's order list, the same
  as clicking the Usage ring in the deals table.

## [2.50.2] - 2026-08-28

### Fixed

- Add/Reduce funds by percent sized the order off the wrong price, so "% of
  position" did not mean the position. The amount was derived from the deal's
  cost basis divided by its `lastPrice`, which reads like a current price but
  is the best price the deal ever filled at — the lowest for a long, the
  highest for a short. Dividing by it resolved a long to more base than the
  deal actually held, and the error grew each time a safety order filled: a
  deal three levels deep resolved 100% to about 1.9% more than it owned, one
  eight levels deep to about 8% more. Past that the engine treats the request
  as covering the whole position and closes the deal, so on a deep ladder a
  93% reduce was a full exit. Percentages now resolve against the deal's
  average entry price, so 100% is the position and 20% is a fifth of it, as
  the help article has always described. Shorts on futures were wrong in the
  opposite direction and are corrected too; spot shorts and coin-M deals were
  never affected. The amount preview in the dialog mirrors the engine, so it
  changes with it.

## [2.49.6] - 2026-08-28

### Fixed

- The bot drawer's Performance chart left a band of empty space at both ends
  instead of filling the plot. It shares one time axis with the Deal Returns
  panel below it, but its equity, realized-profit and buy & hold lines are a
  once-daily midnight snapshot, so they stopped short of an axis that runs to
  the exact time of the first and last deal — on a four-day-old bot that left
  roughly a quarter of the chart blank. The lines now reach both edges: the
  leading edge is seeded from the bot's starting balance and the trailing edge
  carries the last daily reading forward. Bots whose history is longer than the
  90-day series the backend keeps still show the leading gap, because there the
  missing stretch is real history rather than a sampling artifact.

## [2.49.5] - 2026-08-27

### Fixed

- Williams %R with "use percentile" enabled always wasted half the indicator
  pane. Its percentile band was drawn at a fixed 0 and 100, but Williams %R only
  ever runs from -100 to 0, so the pane stretched to -100…100 and the indicator
  was squeezed into the bottom half on every pair — including the ones that
  looked fine for other indicators. The band now follows the indicator's own
  high and low over the percentile lookback.
- The Commodity Channel Index drew its percentile shading at a fixed 0 and 100
  while CCI itself routinely swings past ±300, so the shaded band covered an
  arbitrary slice of the pane and the CCI line sat outside its own band roughly
  two thirds of the time. The shading now spans the indicator's own range.

## [2.49.3] - 2026-08-27

### Fixed

- Chart autoscale no longer breaks when "use percentile" is enabled on an
  indicator whose values are not in the 0-100 range. Momentum, MACD, Awesome
  Oscillator, Bollinger Bands Width, Bollinger Bands %B, Keltner Channel %B and
  the Volume Oscillator drew their percentile band at a fixed 0 and 100, which
  dragged the pane's scale out to 0-100 and flattened the indicator into a line
  along the bottom on any low-priced pair (PUMP, SOL). The band now follows the
  indicator's own high and low over the percentile lookback.

## [2.49.2] - 2026-08-27

### Fixed

- A deal's order list showed amounts in dollars whatever the pair was actually
  priced in — a EUR pair's orders read as "$1,521.81". Prices and totals now
  carry the pair's own quote asset, and an asset with no currency symbol of its
  own gets its ticker instead of a borrowed one.
- Pending smart orders no longer show a placement time of "01/01/1970". They
  have not been placed on the exchange yet, so the order list now leaves the
  time blank rather than printing the epoch.

## [2.49.1] - 2026-08-27

### Fixed

- DCA Analysis no longer shows the previous bot's deal counts after switching
  bots. They were held, with no loading indicator, until the newly selected
  bot's own figures arrived — which read as the numbers flickering between a
  full and a partial count on a refresh cycle.

## [2.49.0] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- DCA Analysis on the bot page now covers every deal a bot has ever had. It
  previously read whatever deals the page had already loaded, which stopped at
  500 — so on a busy bot the figures described only the most recent slice of its
  history.
- The bot page no longer downloads a bot's deals in order to draw DCA Analysis,
  so the section appears immediately and stops re-downloading them every 30
  seconds.

## [2.48.7] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed

- DCA Analysis on the bot page no longer cycles between the correct "Finished
  Deals by DCA Count" figures and much smaller ones. On a bot with more than one
  page of deals the loader could commit a part-loaded snapshot, which deleted the
  rest of that bot's deals from the local cache until the next 30s refresh. The
  deals list in the bot drawer was affected the same way.
- Bots with more deals than the deal view loads at once no longer have the
  remainder dropped from the local cache by a refresh.

## [2.48.6] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed

- The Net P&L column on the trades table no longer double-counts profit a deal
  has already banked. Unrealized P&L already includes realized grid profit
  while a deal is open, so adding the realized figure on top counted every
  completed grid sell twice — one open combo deal read roughly double its
  true profit. Deals that bank nothing before closing (plain DCA) were unaffected.

## [2.48.5] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed

- Volume Filter and Relative Volume Filter in DCA deal-start settings now
  behave as the mutually exclusive pair they are meant to be. Deselecting
  either one cleared both, and selecting one left the other selected, so a bot
  could be saved with both filters on. Turning one on now clears the other, and
  turning one off leaves the other untouched.

## [2.48.4] - 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- The Trades tab on Trading / All Trading no longer under-counts active deals.
  Deals that were still opening (`start`) or had errored (`error`) were dropped
  from the list even though the Bots tab counted them, so a bot with 50 active
  pairs could show only 49 trades. The tab now keeps every deal status the
  backend actually returns for the open view.

## [2.48.3] - 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- Swept the rest of the charts for the same wrong-point tooltip fixed in 2.48.2.
  Recharts matches a hovered tooltip to its row by the X axis value, so any
  chart whose axis label repeats reported the first row carrying that label
  instead of the one under the cursor. Corrected on the bot card equity
  sparkline (one label per day, many points per day), the deal price chart
  (a time of day recurs every day), the bot and grid profit charts, grid profit
  insights, the backtest return distribution and buy-and-hold / performance
  comparisons (two backtests can share a name), the report histogram, the
  manual-backtesting equity curve, the Fear & Greed chart, and the portfolio
  page chart. Weekly profit no longer emits a duplicate week when filling gaps.
- Chart tooltips no longer drop the date line on the first point of a series.

## [2.48.2] - 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- The Portfolio Value chart's tooltip reported the wrong day and value on the
  12M range — hovering the latest point showed the 1st of the month's value
  instead. The X axis was keyed on the visible label, which repeats (every 12M
  point is just "Aug"), and the tooltip resolves its row by matching that label,
  so it always found the month's first point. The axis is now keyed per point.
  This also fixes the same mismatch on any range where several points share one
  label, such as multiple snapshots within a single day.

## [2.48.1] - 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- Dragging a take-profit or stop-loss line on the Edit Deal chart updated the %
  for a moment and then snapped back to the old value. The drag wrote only the
  percentage, but the section keeps that percentage derived from the target's
  price whenever a fixed price is set — so the next render overwrote it. A drag
  now goes through the same path as the chart bullseye, which writes the price,
  the percentage and the flag together.

## [2.48.0] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- Editing one deal now works against the chart the way the Trading Terminal
  does: each take-profit and stop-loss target shows its absolute price
  alongside the %, carries a bullseye that picks a price straight off the
  chart, and draws a line you can drag. Targets stay percentages off the
  deal's average price — the price field, the chart line and the % always
  agree, and dragging or picking converts back to the % the bot acts on.

### Fixed

- The bot drawer's Edit Deal view showed a bare chart: opening it cleared the
  selected deal, so no entry, TP/SL or breakeven was plotted at all. It now
  keeps the chart on the deal being edited, on that deal's pair.

### Changed

- `MultiTarget`'s `isTerminal` prop is now `showPriceTargets`, and the
  Take Profit / Stop Loss sections derive one `supportsPriceTargets` capability
  (terminal OR single-deal edit) instead of each caller passing its own mode
  boolean. Adding a third context that needs price targets is now a one-line
  change in those two sections.

## [2.47.6] - 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- Collapsing a sidebar group that contained the page you were on did nothing:
  the chevron flipped direction but the group stayed expanded. Viewing a
  dashboard kept the Dashboards group permanently open, and the same applied
  to the Trading and Tools section headers. An explicit collapse is now
  respected; groups still auto-expand by default to reveal the current page
  until you toggle them yourself. The chevron also points the right way on
  first load, and collapsing now takes one click instead of two.

## [2.47.5] - 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- Terminal deals showed a Realized P&L of $0.00 on the trade card and in the
  Trade Details drawer, even when the deal had closed at a real profit or loss
  and the Orders tab listed the correct entry and exit prices. The realized
  amount, and the per-asset base/quote breakdown in the drawer, now come from
  the deal's own profit figures like every other deal table.

## [2.47.4] - 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- More menus and dialogs that opened behind the detail drawer, completing the
  2.47.2 sweep. The bot `⋮` menu in the drawer header, the same menu on every
  bot card and bot list row (Trading, Grid, Combo, Hedge), and the profit-chart
  filter dialog inside the bot drawer all pinned themselves below the drawer's
  `z-[55]`.

## [2.47.3] - 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- The market screener is no longer polled every 30 seconds by the dashboard.
  Ten widgets each hand-rolled that query and all ten shared one React Query
  key while asking for different things: three paged the whole coin universe
  (~950 coins, ~2.6 MB) and seven asked for a single page (which the backend
  clamps to 100). Because React Query dedupes by key, whichever widget mounted
  first decided what every other one received — so the market treemap and the
  market heatmap could silently chart 100 coins instead of the full universe,
  and the portfolio widgets could pull 2.6 MB they had no use for. They now
  share two explicit hooks, one per shape of request.
- Screener data is fetched on a 15-minute cadence instead of every 30 seconds.
  It is coin metadata — names, categories, market-cap rank — and since holdings
  are priced from the venue's own rate (2.46.4), nothing here is on a market
  clock any more. This was a public, unauthenticated endpoint being polled
  twice a minute per open dashboard.

## [2.47.2] - 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- Deal and order action menus opened behind the detail drawer. Five menus
  pinned themselves to `z-50`, overriding the shared `z-[70]`; when 2.46.2
  raised the drawer to `z-[55]` so it would sit above the mobile full-screen
  layout, those menus fell below it. The bot drawer's Deals-tab `⋯` menu, the
  Open Orders `⋯` menu, the deal card menu, the mobile global-variable card
  menu and the navbar account menu now use the shared modal-band z-index.

## [2.47.1] - 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- Portfolio balances widget: restore the production build. `Asset.usdValue`
  became `string | null` in 2.46.4, which intersected with the widget's own
  `string | number` override down to `string`, so `tsc -b` rejected every row
  the widget builds.

## [2.47.0] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- Bot details drawer: a **Stats** tab for DCA, Combo and Hedge bots, giving a
  running bot the same statistics view a backtest gets. Overview shows the
  confidence grade, net result, avg daily return, open P&L, max equity
  drawdown, deal durations and the win-rate / profit-factor donuts; Stats shows
  the General, Winners, Losers, Performance Ratios and DCA Usage breakdowns.
  Multi-pair bots also get a per-pair table. Grid bots are unaffected — the
  backend produces no statistics block for them. Everything reads as one
  scroll under the tab, with the grade and both dials on a single row.

## [2.46.4] - 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- Portfolio balances are now valued from the exchange's own USD rate instead of
  by matching the exchange's ticker against the market screener's coin symbols.
  That match was a guess, and a holding it could not resolve was priced at zero:
  a coin renamed upstream (a venue still lists Toncoin as `TON` while the
  screener carries the post-rebrand `gram`) or a long-tail listing the screener
  does not carry rendered a real balance as `$0.00`, silently understating the
  portfolio total. Requires main-app core >= 1.53.5, which supplies the rate via
  `getBalances(input: { includeUsdValues: true })`; against an older backend the
  widget falls back to the previous screener pricing rather than failing.
- An asset that no source can price now says so instead of showing `$0.00`,
  which read as a confident claim that a real holding was worthless.

## [2.46.3] - 2026-08-24

### Fixed

- The Trading Terminal's percentage buttons now use the full amount they
  advertise. "100%" resolved to 99.925% of the stated "Max amount" because the
  trading fee was subtracted a second time, so every preset came up slightly
  short. Importing an existing position is also no longer capped below the
  balance actually held: an import places no order, so no fee is charged and
  the whole free balance can be imported — previously a 100% import left a
  sliver of the coin behind that had to be sold by hand on the exchange.

## [2.46.2] - 2026-08-24

### Fixed

- Detail drawers now open above the full-screen mobile layout. On phones, "Edit"
  in a deal's ⋮ menu on the Trading Terminal (and the same drawers on the bot
  edit pages) closed the menu and appeared to do nothing — the drawer was
  opening behind the full-screen panel layout.

## [2.46.1] - 2026-08-24

### Fixed

- Number fields on mobile now offer a decimal point. Prices, amounts and scale
  fields (for example the Trading Terminal's Import "Purchased Price") opened a
  digits-only keypad on phones, so a decimal value could only be pasted in from
  elsewhere. Integer-only fields such as grid levels and active orders keep the
  whole-number keypad.

## [2.46.0] - 2026-08-24

### Changed

- Saving a bot's settings now tells you what the save actually does: settings apply to new deals only, deals already running keep their current settings and orders, and to change one of those you use the menu on that deal. This matches the backend change in main-app 2.83.0 — a save no longer re-targets or re-places anything on a deal that is already open. Shown on DCA, Combo and Hedge saves; a Grid bot has no per-deal settings and keeps the plain confirmation.

## [2.45.11] - 2026-08-23

### Fixed

- Bot and deal drawers: the price chart sometimes showed a completely different coin's candles than the bot it was opened for, and clicking a deal never corrected it. The chart now always plots the pair it was asked for instead of falling back to whichever pair another chart had loaded last.

## [2.45.10] - 2026-08-22

### Added

- Bot and deal cards: a long press on the card opens its actions menu directly, on every bot type (DCA, Grid, Combo, Hedge) and on deal cards. Reaching an action on touch no longer means hitting the small "⋮" button in the corner.

## [2.45.9] - 2026-08-21

### Fixed

- Exchanges page: a futures account that shares its API key with a spot account (OKX / Bybit unified accounts, incl. OKX Europe X-Perps) showed a $0.00 balance and an empty allocation. The card now reads the shared balance pool recorded under the linked spot account, matching the balance the API already reports for it.

## [2.45.8] - 2026-08-21

### Fixed

- Bot form → DCA overview: the Table view lists every order in the ladder again. It stopped after 10 rows with no way to reach the rest, so a 32-order DCA bot showed 10 orders in the table while the Graph beside it drew all 32 and the Coverage / Avg Down Power / Total Funds tiles were calculated from all 32. Any table rendered without its pagination footer was truncated the same way — the journal's execution list was cut off at 10 too.

## [2.45.7] - 2026-08-21

### Fixed

- Bot form → Take Profit and Stop Loss → Dynamic ATR/ADR: the panel no longer lists indicators that belong to the Indicators close type. They were shown side by side with the ATR/ADR ones and flagged with a "… isn't supported for Dynamic ATR/ADR" error — on take profit that happened just by opening the tab on a bot closing by indicators, and on stop loss after visiting Indicators first, even where no stop-loss indicator was saved at all. Both panels now show only the ATR/ADR indicators the mode actually uses, which is what the bot saves and trades on.

## [2.45.6] - 2026-08-21

### Fixed

- Settings → Personal Data: your saved nickname shows up again after a reload. It was stored correctly all along, but the Settings page never asked the API for it, so the Nickname box came back blank on every visit and looked as though the save had been lost.

## [2.45.5] - 2026-08-21

### Fixed

- Indicator-triggered DCA: each DCA level's "DCA order amount" is shown again — in the bot Settings view as well as the editor — on bots that close their deal on indicators rather than on a fixed take profit. Those bots carry a stored "volume based on required change" flag that the trading engine ignores, but the form was hiding the per-level amount because of it, so the volume the bot actually trades (and any global variable bound to it) was invisible and uneditable.

## [2.45.4] - 2026-08-21

### Fixed

- Bot form balance ("BAL") for a futures account that shares its API key with a spot account (OKX / Bybit unified accounts, incl. OKX Europe X-Perps) no longer shows 0 — the form now reads the shared balance pool stored under the linked spot account, as the legacy dashboard did.

## [2.45.3] - 2026-08-21

### Changed

- DCA/Combo bots: the orders-count limit now budgets **orders resting on the exchange**, not ladder depth. Previously "DCA orders" was capped at 200 ÷ max open deals whether or not smart orders were on — a bot with 5 concurrent deals could not describe a ladder deeper than 40, which blocked migrating deep-ladder strategies from other platforms. With smart orders on, only `activeOrdersCount` levels rest on the exchange, so the ladder now runs to the full 200 and the exchange budget is enforced on the smart-orders count instead.

### Fixed

- Smart orders count on a **multi-pair** bot was budgeted against "max open deals" instead of "max deals per pair" — the setting such a bot does not use. It now divides by the same setting the rest of the form does.
- The smart-orders helper text no longer prints its range twice ("From 1 to 40 • From 1 to 40 (…)").

## [2.45.2] - 2026-08-21

### Fixed

- OKX Europe paper accounts no longer offer "USD" as funding (no such asset on the EU venue); X-Perp paper margin defaults to USDC, matching the USDC-quoted X-Perp pairs, so paper bots can actually open deals.
- X-Perp pair parsing fallback reports USDC as the quote, consistent with pair metadata.

## [2.45.1] - 2026-08-21

### Fixed

- Bot details drawer (Settings tab): on a multi-pair bot the "+ Load all (N more)" link now works. It did nothing at all, so on a bot with 18 pairs only the first 10 were ever visible and the remaining 8 could not be reached from the drawer at all. The section collapse chevrons on the same panel were dead for the same reason and now work too.

## [2.45.0] - 2026-08-21

### Changed

- The Change Password form now asks for your current password, and requires it. This pairs with main-app 2.82.0 / core 1.52.0, where the backend started requiring it (GHSA-4m6h-m5mj-733x). **Both must be upgraded together** — an older dashboard against the new backend cannot change a password, and this dashboard against an older backend will be told the field is unknown.
- Changing your password now signs out your other sessions; the session you changed it from stays signed in.

## [2.44.4] - 2026-08-21

### Fixed

- Bot details drawer (Settings tab): the "DCA order amount" no longer reads 0 on pairs quoted in BTC or ETH. A bot saved with a 0.00011 BTC DCA order size showed 0 in the drawer while Base Order Size on the same panel correctly showed 0.00011.

## [2.44.3] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed

- Watchlist widget: with enough pairs to fill the widget, the last row was sliced off at the widget's bottom edge and the "Add Pair" button disappeared entirely — nothing could be scrolled, so those rows (and their remove X) were unreachable. The list now scrolls.

## [2.44.2] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed

- DCA bots: the "DCA order amount" field no longer rounds what you type down to 0 on pairs quoted in BTC or ETH (e.g. ETH/BTC on Bybit, where the exchange minimum is 0.000065 BTC). The field now accepts as many decimals as the pair actually needs, and the 25% / 50% / 75% buttons fill in a real amount instead of 0.

## [2.44.1] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed

- Accumulated Profit: the All period no longer shows a nonsensical change percentage. When the selected period already covers everything you have ever earned there is no earlier balance to compare against, so the widget now shows "—" instead of a huge number such as -722,195,614,853,520,000.00%. Period Start no longer reads "-$0.00", and the Rising/Falling label now follows the profit actually made in the period, so a period that gained money is never labelled "Falling".

## [2.44.0] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- A deal that was created but never opened now says why. When the exchange refuses the order that opens a deal, the deal is already listed — with no orders, no entry price and no profit — and until now nothing on it explained the refusal; the bot's warning went to the notification bell, which names neither the deal nor the pair and collapses hours of repeats into one line. Nor could the exchange's own order history explain it: the orders were never sent, so nothing about them was ever recorded there. The deal now carries the exchange's reason, when it will be retried, and whether the restriction covers one pair or the whole account, shown on the deal card and behind the status dot in the deals tables. It is presented as waiting, not as an error, because that is what it is — these deals open by themselves once the exchange accepts the order.

## [2.43.33] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed

- Watchlist widget: pairs added from a futures market (e.g. Bybit Linear/Inverse, Binance USD-M/COIN-M) sat on "Connecting..." forever and never showed a price — only three spot exchanges could ever connect, so every other market the pair picker offers was permanently stuck. Those pairs now stream live prices, and a pair on an exchange we have no price feed for says "Price unavailable" instead of pretending to connect.
- Watchlist widget: a pair added to an already-running watchlist did not start streaming until the connection happened to drop and re-establish.
- Watchlist widget: Bybit rows showed a 24h change roughly 100x too small.
- Watchlist widget: removing a pair also removed the same symbol on every other exchange. Only the row you pick is removed now.
- Watchlist widget: the remove (X) button only appeared on hover, so it was invisible on phones and tablets and watchlist entries could not be deleted there. It is now always shown when hovering isn't possible.

## [2.43.32] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed

- Table filters no longer disappear when a page reloads. Any table's filters were written into the address bar in a form that couldn't be read back, and on the next load that unreadable value overwrote the filters you had set. Most visible on the bots pages, where pressing the "B" navigation shortcut while already on the page reloads it and cleared the filters every time. Filters now survive a reload, and a link you copy from the address bar reproduces them for whoever opens it — including numeric ranges and multi-value filters, which previously came back wrong.
- Mobile bottom bar: a dashboard added to the bar stayed until the next launch and then vanished, along with anything else added after it. Items are now restored exactly as saved.

## [2.43.31] - 2026-08-15

### Fixed

- Overview "Top Deals": a deal's unrealized P&L is now worked out the same way as on the bot's own Deals tab — from the live price and net of the exchange fees to open and close the position. The widget was showing the fee-free figure the server reports, so the same deal could read as a small profit on the Overview and a loss inside the bot. Deals are also ranked by that corrected value now.

## [2.43.30] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- Bot drawer: the Performance chart plotted only the equity line — Realized Profit and Buy & Hold were drawn as flat $0 lines (and flattened the equity axis with them). Both series are now fetched and plotted again, and a series the bot has no data for is left off the chart instead of being drawn at zero.

## [2.43.29] - 2026-08-14

### Changed

- Editing a combo bot's deal now matches the old dashboard field for field: order size, "DCA grid range" and "DCA grid levels" are read-only there, because they describe the minigrid that was already placed when the deal opened. Everything the old dashboard lets you change on a deal — DCA orders, volume and step scale, minimum deviation, take-profit and stop-loss — is still editable. Editing a plain DCA deal is unchanged, including its order size.

## [2.43.28] - 2026-08-14

### Changed

- "DCA grid levels" is now read-only while editing a single deal, matching the legacy dashboard. A deal's minigrid is laid out when the deal opens, so changing how many levels it has partway through does not describe the orders already placed. The field is still shown, seeded with the deal's own value; change it on the bot to affect new deals.

### Fixed

- The deals table no longer contains NUL characters. They were an internal separator, invisible on screen, but they made the file read as binary — so a text search over the codebase silently found nothing in it. Two separate investigations concluded a working feature was dead code because of this.

## [2.43.27] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- Editing a deal that belongs to a combo bot now works. Saving one failed every time with "Failed to edit deal": the drawer treated every deal as a DCA deal, so the change was sent to the wrong place and the deal could not be found. Combo deals were effectively uneditable from the deal drawer.
- The combo grid settings — including "DCA grid levels" — are now shown when editing a combo bot's deal. The drawer previously rendered the plain-DCA settings for every deal, so these were missing entirely. The field itself is read-only when editing a deal — see 2.43.28.

## [2.43.26] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- Test coverage for creating a bot. Everything that checked the bot form's save path — including the 163-field round-trip probe — only ever exercised editing an existing bot, and creating one runs different code: the payload is assembled from a different base, empty values are handled differently, and the backend stores a new bot exactly as sent instead of merging it over what was already there. A setting could therefore be correct when you edit a bot and wrong when you create one, with nothing to catch it. The suite now checks every setting both ways and requires them to agree, and a browser test creates a bot through the real form and confirms it comes back with the settings that were chosen. No discrepancy was found.
- The build-time guard against sending the backend a field it does not accept now covers bot creation as well as saving. Creation is the more exposed of the two — nothing filters the payload before it is sent, so one undeclared field would stop anyone from creating a bot at all.

## [2.43.25] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- Scope the bot-save guard's schema checks to the save mutations. They also inspected the bot-creation mutations, which legitimately accept several of the fields a save has to leave out, so the guard would have reported a correct schema as broken.

## [2.43.24] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- Extend the bot-save guard to grid bots. The check added in 2.43.23 covered DCA and combo bots; grid bots save through a different, much smaller API and were still unguarded, so adding a setting to the grid form could have broken saving for every grid bot with nothing to catch it.

## [2.43.23] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- Build-time guard against a bot save that carries a field the backend does not accept. Saving a bot sends only the fields the API declares, and the list of what to leave out was maintained by hand in three places — so adding a new setting to the bot form could break saving for every bot of that type at once. The test suite now checks this on every build.

## [2.43.22] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- Indicator settings are no longer stripped when a bot uses indicators for more than one purpose. On a bot combining, say, start-DCA-by-indicator with indicator-based deal closing, saving quietly discarded the options you had left at their defaults on one of the two indicators — a moving-average indicator could lose its MA types and lengths and come back re-tuned to a different period.
- The Enter Market Timeout toggle stays on after a reload. It saved correctly but always reappeared switched off, with the seconds still filled in — and a later save of anything else then turned the feature off for real.
- Grid bots remember their direction. A Short grid bot always reloaded as Long, so cloning one produced a bot trading the opposite way with no warning.
- "DCA grid levels" can be changed from the deal-edit drawer on a combo bot. The drawer closed as though it had saved, but the new value was never sent.

## [2.43.21] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- A fixed stop-loss price survives a page reload. 2.43.19 made it save correctly, but the bot form never read it back, so the price showed as empty and the mode as off the next time the bot was opened — the take-profit equivalent had always been read.

## [2.43.20] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- Bot settings you cannot see are no longer reset when you save. A setting the bot form did not explicitly handle on save was sent to the backend as its factory default rather than left alone, so saving any part of a bot could quietly change an unrelated setting back to the stock value. This is the shared cause of the last six "I changed it, it didn't stick" fixes; the form now sends what it is actually showing you.
- The Risk:Reward stop-loss type and its fixed value survive a page reload. 2.43.19 made them save correctly, but the bot form never read them back, so they showed the default again the next time the bot was opened.

## [2.43.19] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- A fixed stop-loss price is saved. Switching the stop loss to a fixed price and entering one was discarded on save — the take-profit equivalent worked, the stop-loss half was never sent.
- The AND/OR choice for the Bot Controller's start and stop indicator lists is saved. Either one set to OR reverted to AND.
- The Risk:Reward stop-loss type and its fixed value are saved. Choosing a fixed stop loss reverted to the indicator-derived one.

## [2.43.18] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- "Close order type" keeps the order type you pick. Setting it to Market and saving reverted it to Limit on every bot whose deal-close condition was the default take profit — which is most of them. The setting is offered regardless of close condition, but it was only being saved for the technical-indicator and dynamic ATR/ADR conditions.

## [2.43.17] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- Saving a DCA bot, or a combo bot on a futures account, no longer switches "Include fees in order calculation" on behind your back. The setting is only shown for combo bots on spot; everywhere else the save payload fell back to the form's default — which is on — and wrote it over whatever the bot had. On DCA bots that is a live setting: the bot places separate fee orders and accounts for the fee balance when it is on.

## [2.43.16] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- "Limit deals per higher timeframe bar" can be switched off. Turning it off and saving left it on: the save payload only carried the setting while it was enabled, so the form's default — which is on — showed through and was written back to the bot every time.

## [2.43.15] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- The bot form shows how many trading pairs are selected. With multiple pairs enabled, a count chip sits next to the Single/Multiple switch and turns amber once the plan's pair limit is reached, so the total is visible without scrolling the picker.

## [2.43.14] - 2026-08-13

### Removed

- The webhook configuration modal no longer offers "Enter Long", "Enter Short", "Exit Long" and "Exit Short" for futures and COIN-M bots. The platform has never acted on those four signals — sending one returned a success response and did nothing. Direction is a bot setting, so "Start Deal" already opens in the bot's configured direction and "Close Deal" already exits it.

## [2.43.13] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed

- The pair picker tells contract markets apart. A COIN-M or dated-futures venue lists several markets that are all `BASE / QUOTE` — Binance COIN-M has `BTCUSD_PERP`, `BTCUSD_260925` and `BTCUSD_261225`, Bybit linear has nine BTC/USDT contracts — and the picker showed only base and quote, so they rendered as identical repeated rows with no way to tell which contract you were selecting. Each now carries its exchange symbol.
- Searching a pair by its concatenated symbol finds it. The rows were matched against `ETH/BTC` and `ETH-BTC` only, so typing `ETHBTC` — the form the bot stores, and the one the old dashboard showed — returned nothing. On a venue with dated futures, searching `BTCUSDT` returned the eight `BTCUSDT-<expiry>` contracts and hid the actual BTCUSDT perpetual.
- Pairs that don't match the bot's quote (or base, for short and COIN-M bots) are greyed out with an explanation instead of being removed from the list. Hiding them was indistinguishable from the exchange not listing the pair at all.
- Replacing a bot's only trading pair offers every pair the exchange lists. The quote/base constraint that applies when *adding* a pair alongside others was also applied when swapping the single pair out — leaving "No items found" for pairs the venue plainly offers, even though the replacement becomes the only pair and has nothing to be consistent with.
- Selected-pair chips on COIN-M and other contract markets show their coin icons again, instead of a blank coin and a question mark.
- The "Restored your unsaved bot" notice spaces its text and buttons properly and stops overflowing the builder's side panel on narrow screens.

## [2.43.12] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed

- Amount and Total fields keep the asset label clear of the value for long tickers. The label had a fixed amount of room, so anything past about seven characters — `FARTCOIN`, `1000PEPE`, `XYZ:SP500` — printed over the number. Labels that already fit are unaffected.

## [2.43.11] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed

- A paper account funded in a non-dollar asset can be created again. The starting balance was checked against a flat $100 minimum whatever the asset, so funding a COIN-M futures account — which is margined in the base coin — with 0.2 BTC was rejected as below $100. The minimum and maximum now scale to the asset being funded, and the message names it.

## [2.43.10] - 2026-08-13

### Changed

- Amount and Total fields label a Hyperliquid builder-dex market by its underlying asset — `xyz:SP500` now reads `SP500`, with the full symbol on hover. The prefix names the dex that listed the market rather than the asset, and it pushed the label over the value.

## [2.43.9] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed

- The terminal's Amount field shows the real asset badge for non-crypto markets. Indices, tokenized stocks, metals and FX rendered as a plain first-letter tile there — a Hyperliquid builder-dex market like `xyz:SP500` showed an "X" — because the field asked the crypto icon host for a symbol it has no entry for.

## [2.43.8] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed

- A deal's Smart/Simple type is restored when its settings are reloaded. It was written on save but never read back, so a deal saved as Simple reopened as Smart — which changes which take-profit and stop-loss controls the form offers.

### Added

- Save round-trip coverage for the bot form: every field of every bot type is set individually and pushed through form → payload → form, so a field that is written on save but lost on reload fails a test. The unit suite now also runs in CI.

## [2.43.7] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed

- A DCA bot's "Cooldown after deal close" interval no longer reverts to the "Cooldown after deal start" interval. The field displayed the start cooldown's value, so any number entered appeared to snap back to 1 after saving.

### Added

- `npm run verify:forms` checks every bot-form control for a value that reads one form field while its handler writes another — the defect above, which type-check and lint both accept. It runs in CI alongside the type-check, lint, and CSS-contract steps.

## [2.43.6] - 2026-08-12

### Fixed

- The Profit Currency buttons in a DCA bot's settings are no longer greyed out when the bot has open deals. They now stay editable, with a notice explaining that the change applies to new deals and that running deals keep the currency they entered with — the behavior (and the wording) the previous dashboard had.

## [2.43.5] - 2026-08-12

### Changed

- The DCA orders step is no longer capped at a flat 10%. The ceiling now follows what the deal can actually trade: shorts can go up to 500% per step (price has no upper bound, so a spike can be covered with 3-5 orders), while longs are held to the 100%-from-entry envelope — 33.3% on a 3-order ladder, 20% on 5, and just under 100% for indicator- and custom-spaced ladders, which chain off the previous order instead of off entry. The step still can't go below the exchange/fee minimum, and the helper line under the field says which limit is binding. Applies to the Scaled step, each indicator's "Minimum % from last filled order", each Custom ladder level, and the ATR/ADR minimum-deviation guard — in the bot form and in backtests alike.

## [2.43.4] - 2026-08-12

### Fixed

- The backtest History table on the bot create/edit pages no longer rebuilds its toolbar on every live update. The backtest list was handed back as a brand-new list on each render, so the whole History panel — and its Filter / Resize / Columns toolbar — was rebuilt on every price and deal tick, making the page sluggish and risking React's update-depth limit blanking it.

## [2.43.3] - 2026-08-12

### Changed

- OKX Europe X-Perp futures are now beta-gated: only beta testers (Alpha group) can add EU futures connections or see EU futures accounts in the bot form; everyone else gets the spot-only behavior with a "beta, coming soon" notice in the add-exchange dialog.

## [2.43.1] - 2026-08-12

### Fixed

- The bot action buttons (Start/Stop, Restart, Edit) no longer re-render on every live update. On a busy bot the bot details drawer rebuilt its whole action bar on each price/deal tick, which made the drawer sluggish and could trip React's update-depth limit and blank the page.

## [2.43.0] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- Add Funds and Reduce Funds now work on a multi-deal selection, not just one deal at a time. Select the deals, pick the amount once, and it is applied to each of them — available in the bot details drawer, the Trading page Trades tab, the Trading Terminal and the Open Orders widget. Both actions previously answered with "Coming soon".

### Changed

- The funds dialog says how many deals it is about to act on, and spells out that the amount entered is applied to each selected deal rather than split between them. The asset picker only names the pair's base and quote assets when every selected deal shares them.
- The bulk Add/Reduce Funds actions only appear when at least one selected deal can actually take a funds adjustment, and deals in the selection that can't (closed, cancelled, or combo) are skipped with a note instead of failing.

## [2.42.33] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed

- Responsive spacing now actually applies. Layouts that were meant to breathe more on wider screens — and directional margins and padding throughout the app — were written against spacing classes the stylesheet never generated, so they quietly did nothing. The spacing scale now covers every direction and every breakpoint.
- Light and dark styling now follows the theme you pick in the app rather than your operating system's appearance setting. If your device was set to dark while the app was set to light (or the reverse), some text and highlight colours were taken from the wrong theme.

### Changed

- Spacing tokens (`xs`/`sm`/`md`/`lg`/`xl`) keep tracking the Comfortable/Compact setting, and now do so across every spacing utility rather than a partial subset.

## [2.42.32] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed

- An expired session now returns you to the login screen instead of leaving the app open on a page where every panel reads "Error Loading …". Sign-in was only ever checked once, when the tab was first opened, so a session that ran out — or one the app couldn't confirm because the connection dropped at that moment — stayed on screen until you reloaded by hand.

## [2.42.31] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed

- Filters now work the same way in card view as in table view on every bot list. The Filters button was missing on the Hedge DCA and Hedge Combo pages, did nothing on the Grid and Combo pages, and was hidden entirely in card view on All Trades — all four now open the same "Add filter" bar, where you can stack conditions and save filter sets.
- The filter bar now sits on the same surface as the cards and rows it filters, instead of a full-width strip with a hard bottom edge.
- Column filters in table view no longer spill out of their column. The operator, the selected values and the clear button stay on one line and shrink to fit, so a narrow column shows a shortened value instead of a broken cell.

### Fixed

- A disabled Save button on the bot form now explains why it is disabled instead of giving no reason.

## [2.42.28] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- The Trading Bots page no longer blanks to a bare error when a refresh fails — your bots stay on screen, and when there is genuinely nothing to show it explains why and offers a retry.

## [2.42.27] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- Read whether a maintenance window blocks the dashboard or is only advisory.

## [2.42.26] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- Ask the backend which bot types are restarting, alongside the maintenance check that already runs (cloud only).

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.42.25] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- Trading terminal: the "Avg Price" column and the deal card's "Avg Buy/Sell Price" now show the deal's real running average instead of staying frozen at the initial entry price. Adding funds to an existing trade updates the value straight away, and it no longer disagrees with the average shown for the same deal on the bot deals tables.

## [2.42.24] - 2026-08-05

### Fixed

- Hyperliquid: connecting with "Free (approve builder fees)" no longer fails with an unexplained error. The builder-address lookup used a malformed URL, so the wallet was never asked to approve the builder fee and the connection was then refused for an approval the user was never prompted for. If the lookup does fail, setup now stops and says so instead of reporting success.

## [2.42.23] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- Self-hosted admin: generate this installation's encryption key from the Admin page when one is not set yet. The key is shown once for the operator to save and written to the host `.env`; the page says what to run for the stack to pick it up. The card disappears once a key is configured.

## [2.42.22] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- Self-hosted: a dismissible notice recommending the operator set an encryption key of their own, shown only while the installation is still using the one that ships with the build

## [2.42.21] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- Bot builder: unsaved settings are kept locally and restored if you navigate away or reload, with a notice offering to start fresh
- Bot builder: warn before leaving the page with unsaved changes

### Fixed

- Bot builder: upsell and help links no longer reload the whole app, which used to discard a half-configured bot

## [2.42.20] - 2026-08-04

### Fixed

- Hedge and combo bots no longer reset "Minimum deviation" to 0. The bot's
  stored value was never loaded, so the field always opened at 0 and — on
  hedge bots, which save only the fields that changed — the number typed in
  was silently dropped from the update, leaving it permanently at 0. Affects
  Scaled DCA setups where the deviation matters most (e.g. ATR).

## [2.42.19] - 2026-08-02

### Fixed

- Binance US bots no longer show a Value of $0.00. The dashboard never
  requested Binance US prices, so those bots had no market data to value their
  position against — the Value field showed the correct number for a moment
  after a page refresh and then dropped to $0.00 once the other exchanges'
  prices arrived, leaving the field stuck in its dimmed "Updating value with
  latest prices…" state.
- A bot whose exchange is missing from the price feed now falls back to the
  Value the server already calculated instead of displaying $0.00.

## [2.42.18] - 2026-08-02

### Fixed

- Bot form: saving a bot now stores every indicator setting the form was showing,
  not only the ones the document already held. A parameter the user never touched
  was drawn from the indicator's own default (a MAR row showed "EMA", "Current
  price" and a comparison length of 20) but was absent from the saved bot, so
  re-saving wrote the same gaps straight back and an affected bot could not be
  repaired. Values that were actually set are never overwritten.
- MAR: "Base MA length" defaults to 20 again, matching the value the trading
  engine has always used for a bot that never set one. It had drifted to 10,
  which showed the wrong number on screen and — now that an untouched setting
  is saved — would have re-tuned the bot on its first save.

## [2.42.17] - 2026-08-02

### Fixed

- Charts: a Moving Average Ratio (MAR) indicator with Percentile Ranking enabled no
  longer forces its pane onto a 0-100 price scale. MAR is a ratio centered on 1.0, but
  its percentile reference band was drawn at the fixed values 100 and 0 (correct only
  for studies whose own domain is 0-100, like RSI or MFI), so the MAR line collapsed
  into a sliver at the bottom of the pane and the axis showed `100.00000000`. The band
  now follows the highest/lowest MAR value over the percentile lookback window, so the
  pane scales to the ratio's own range.

## [2.42.16] - 2026-08-02

### Fixed

- Bot create/edit forms (`/bot/new`, `/bot/edit`, `/combo/*`, `/grid/*`): the footer's
  quick-backtest bar, its options menu, the "Capital required" chip, and the
  Start/Stop control no longer rebuild on every render. Typing in the form or a live
  price tick was handing the (memoized) footer button rows brand-new-but-identical
  button and menu arrays, re-rendering them on every tick and tripping the render-loop
  watchdog. The chip and the buttons still update immediately whenever what they show
  actually changes.

## [2.42.15] - 2026-08-02

### Fixed

- Page-visit tracking no longer restarts a visit when only the page title or the
  trading mode changes. Pages whose title or mode settles after mount (bot and
  rulebook detail pages, and the demo-exit flow on Add Exchange) were having a
  single visit chopped into sub-second fragments that Recent Items then dropped.

## [2.42.14] - 2026-08-02

### Fixed

- The Moving Average Ratio (MAR) indicator's "Value" threshold now defaults to 0.99 and steps by
  0.01 instead of defaulting to 80 with a step of 1. MAR is a ratio between two moving averages, so
  it sits around 1.0 — a threshold of 80 could never be crossed and the condition silently never
  fired. The smaller step also lets the field be linked to a decimal global variable.

## [2.42.13] - 2026-08-02

### Fixed

- The Moving Average Ratio (MAR) and Moving Averages (MA) indicators now name their candle-count
  fields after the moving average currently selected — "EMA Length" instead of "Base MA length",
  "WMA Length" instead of "Comparison MA length", and "EMA length"/"EMA interval" instead of
  "Comparison length"/"Comparison interval". The label follows the type dropdown as you change it,
  so a length no longer states a number of candles without saying which average it smooths.

## [2.42.12] - 2026-08-02

### Fixed

- Changing an existing DCA indicator's type now carries the new indicator's own settings across. A DCA ladder row starts life as RSI, and switching it to another type swapped only the name — the new type's options were left blank, so a Moving Average Ratio (MAR) row kept RSI's numbers and had no Reference, "Relative to" or "Comparison MA length" of its own. Beyond showing the wrong fields, such a row reached the trading engine incomplete, with no warm-up length to calculate and no reference type to read.
- The indicator summary card on a saved bot no longer lists settings the form itself hides. A MAR indicator with Reference "Current price" summarised as "Comparison MA length: 20" — a setting that does not apply — while the options that do apply were pushed off the card.

## [2.42.11] - 2026-08-02

### Fixed

- A Moving Average Ratio (MAR) indicator whose Reference is "Current price" now draws on the bot chart. Its pane, legend and percentile bounds appeared, but the ratio and percentile lines were blank on every bar: the chart spelled the "current price" reference in capitals, which the chart study does not recognise as a price reference, so it had nothing to compare against. Since "Current price" is MAR's default Reference, most MAR indicators were in this state. Backtests and live bots were never affected — only the chart.

## [2.42.10] - 2026-08-02

### Fixed

- Indicator settings on a saved bot no longer show fields that should be hidden. Any option the bot never explicitly stored came back from the server as "no value" instead of as absent, so the form stopped treating it as untouched and skipped its own default. The visible symptom was on Moving Average Ratio (MAR): with Reference left at "Current price", the "Comparison MA length" field stayed on screen even though that setting does not apply to it. This affected every indicator whose fields appear or hide based on another field, not just MAR.

## [2.42.9] - 2026-08-02

### Fixed

- Self-hosted installs no longer make a failing market-data request on every page that shows a bot chart. The chart asked for figures only the hosted service can supply (reference price, market-cap rank, categories), so the request was rejected four times per page load and filled the browser console with errors, burying real ones. Those optional figures are now requested only where they exist; nothing else on the chart changes.
- Opening a bot page no longer logs the ordinary "still loading" state as an error. The bot form reported a missing exchange and an empty pair list at error level on every visit, before that data had arrived, and then resolved a moment later.

## [2.42.8] - 2026-08-02

### Fixed

- Editing a bot no longer resets "Close by timer" to 10 minutes. The edit form never read the saved timer amount and unit back from the bot, so it always opened showing the 10-minutes default — and saving any unrelated change (a budget increase, for example) wrote that default over the stored setting. Hedge bots were hit hardest, since both legs get saved together.

## [2.42.7] - 2026-08-02

### Fixed

- Settings → API Keys and Settings → License Key now load on self-hosted installs. Both pages read from the same account request, which asked for a two-factor-authentication field that self-hosted builds don't provide — the server rejected the entire request, so every setting on it came back empty and the pages reported "No API keys found" and "No license key set" even though the values were stored. That field is now requested only where two-factor authentication exists.

## [2.42.6] - 2026-08-01

### Fixed

- Backtest results now say when a run covered less than the period you selected. Exchanges cap how far back their candle history reaches — Kraken spot, for example, serves only its most recent 720 candles per timeframe, so a 210-day 1h backtest quietly tested 30 days. The results header now shows a "Partial history — X of Y days" warning, with the reason on hover, whenever the tested window starts later than the one requested.

## [2.42.5] - 2026-08-01

### Fixed

- Opening the new-bot form from a staged configuration (e.g. "Copy to live", a curated preset, or a wizard hand-off) no longer shows "Something went wrong" when the staged trading pair was stored as a number instead of text. The pair is now read as text and the form loads normally.

## [2.42.4] - 2026-08-01

### Fixed

- Opening the trading terminal on a specific deal type (e.g. a link ending in `?dealType=simple`) now selects that tab. The address was being rewritten back to `smart`, so you landed on the wrong tab, and the resulting tug-of-war between the address bar and the form could escalate into a "Maximum update depth exceeded" crash.

## [2.42.3] - 2026-08-01

### Changed

- Loading candles for charts and backtests is much faster on Hyperliquid, Kraken futures and Bitget futures. Those venues serve far bigger pages than we were asking for, so every period was split into many more round-trips than necessary — a 7-month 15m Hyperliquid load took 103 requests and now takes 5. The candles loaded are identical; only the number of requests changes.

## [2.42.2] - 2026-08-01

### Fixed

- Server-side backtests now run with the settings you picked. Choosing "Server Side" in the backtest dialog ignored the candle timeframe, period, fee and slippage you had just set and always tested the last 365 days at 1h with 0% slippage, and the date range it did compute never reached the backend at all. Client-side (in-browser) backtests were unaffected.

## [2.42.1] - 2026-08-01

### Fixed

- Signing back in no longer immediately logs you out again on a slow connection. Requests still in flight from the previous session could resolve after re-login with the backend's "session expired" rejection, and the app treated that as the new session being dead — signing the user out and revoking the fresh session server-side, over and over. A rejection now only ends the session whose token was actually rejected.

## [2.42.0] - 2026-08-01

### Added

- Exchanges and Portfolio pages show a "Replace key" chip on any exchange connection whose API key was still in place before 31 July, recommending it be replaced. Clicking it opens the edit dialog. Hyperliquid connections get the Web3-wallet wording instead of the create-a-new-key steps. The chip disappears once the key is replaced.

### Fixed

- Links in notifications are now clickable. A notification that cites a help page rendered its URL as plain text you had to select and copy.

## [2.41.4] - 2026-07-31

### Fixed

- Exchange add/edit: a failed connection showed the raw API response as a wall of JSON that overflowed the error box. It now shows the sentence the server actually wrote, and long messages wrap.

## [2.41.3] - 2026-07-31

### Fixed

- Signing out is now immediate when the backend rejects your session. Previously an invalidated session left the dashboard loaded but non-functional — every panel showed an error while the app still considered you logged in, and you had to clear site data by hand. The app now returns you to the login screen as soon as the server refuses the session. Sessions are still preserved through network drops and backend outages, so a temporary connection problem will not sign you out.

## [2.41.2] - 2026-07-31

### Fixed

- Overview: when the trading-pairs or exchanges request failed or was slow, the dashboard kept re-issuing it in a self-sustaining loop instead of stopping after the normal retries. It now retries a bounded number of times and then surfaces the error — which also removes the render loop that could crash the page outright while that was happening.

## [2.41.1] - 2026-07-31

### Fixed

- DCA bot form: switching a take-profit or stop-loss close condition no longer deletes that section's configured indicators and groups — your configuration is kept and comes back when you switch mode again. Switching take profit to Dynamic ATR/ADR no longer wipes the take-profit indicators when the stop loss happens to be on Indicators.
- DCA bot form: the saved bot now carries only the indicators the active close condition actually uses (grouped indicators for Indicators, ungrouped ATR/ADR for Dynamic ATR/ADR, none for Percentage or webhook), so a leftover indicator can no longer be picked up as the dynamic take-profit distance. Groups left empty by that filter are dropped too.
- DCA bot form: creating a bot no longer fails with an unexplained error after leaving an untouched seeded indicator behind — the raw form indicators are no longer sent alongside the mapped ones.
- DCA bot form: Dynamic ATR/ADR now seeds its ATR even when the section still holds indicators from Indicators mode, and Create Bot is blocked with an explanatory error when a Dynamic ATR/ADR take profit or stop loss has no ATR/ADR indicator.

## [2.41.0] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- OKX Europe X-Perp futures support: the EU origin (my.okx.com) now allows Spot & Futures / Linear Futures adds (Inverse auto-corrects to Linear — the EU venue has no coin-margined product), paper OKX accounts gain the origin selector, and OKX-EU paper funding uses USDC/EUR/USD lists (no USDT on the EU venue). Based on work contributed by a community member.

### Fixed

- X-Perp pairs no longer break the quick-backtest symbol resolution (pairMetadata lookups now use the normalized pair key; asset fallback uses the suffix-aware parser instead of a midpoint slice) — previously every USD-denominated backtest stat rendered as $0.00.
- `extractPairAssets` strips the X-Perp contract-family suffix so display/icon lookups get the real quote asset (`USD`, not `USD_UM_XPERP`).

## [2.40.1] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed

- The Portfolio Value widget's "Coins" filter is usable again. Its "Add coins"
  picker came up empty ("No items found") so no coin could be typed or selected,
  because the chart's default all-coins/all-exchanges view fetches a lean series
  without the per-asset breakdown the picker lists from. The picker now reads the
  breakdown separately when it is opened.
- The Portfolio Value coin picker and its filter chips now list every coin in the
  loaded history, not only those held in the oldest snapshot of the range — a
  coin acquired later was missing from the picker and its chart series would not
  draw when selected.
- Picking a coin while "All coins" is still selected now draws that coin's line
  over the total, instead of leaving the chart unchanged.

## [2.40.0] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- The bot page's price chart is now deal-aware. While a DCA or Combo bot has an
  open deal on the charted pair, the chart draws that deal's real resting orders
  and its projected next DCA levels — the same indication the deal drawer shows
  — instead of the settings preview, which is projected from the current market
  price and so never lined up with a running deal. The deal's own fills appear
  as buy/sell markers alongside them.
- An "Active deal orders" item in the chart's display menu switches back to the
  settings preview, for tuning a bot's parameters while a deal is open. It only
  appears when there is an open deal to show.

### Changed

- The chart's display menu now shows each option's current state as a checkbox
  instead of an unlabelled "Toggle …" action, so it's clear what is on.

### Fixed

- Changing the chart's display menu left the old "Chart" button behind on the
  toolbar, stacking up a duplicate per change. Removing the previous button
  silently did nothing because the dropdown handle was never awaited, and two
  overlapping attaches could each add one; the menu is now rebuilt in place.
- Opening a bot page could crash it with "Maximum update depth exceeded". The
  bot-deals hook re-ran a state-setting effect on every render whenever a caller
  passed its filter inline, which every caller does.

## [2.39.12] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed

- Projected DCA levels on the price chart were labelled "Smart order" for bots
  whose DCA condition is an indicator. Those bots never rest a DCA order on the
  exchange — each level is just the "Minimum % from last filled order"
  threshold the indicator has to clear — so they now read "DCA (min. %)".
  `dcaByMarket` levels read "DCA by market", matching the legacy dashboard.
- Indicator-condition bots now show their projected DCA levels on the chart even
  with Smart orders switched off. Smart orders have no effect for that condition,
  so gating the indication on it hid it for no reason.
- The next-DCA indication on an open deal's chart is now anchored on the deal's
  last filled price, the same reference the bot uses when it evaluates the
  minimum-%. It previously chained off the deal's initial price through its own
  projected levels, which drew the next DCA closer than it could actually happen
  once a level filled below its threshold. Levels the deal has already taken no
  longer show up as pending.

## [2.39.11] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed

- Advanced Bot Stats widget: the x-axis date labels on the Accumulated
  Profit / Equity chart overlapped the `7D / 30D / 90D / 1Y / All` range
  buttons underneath it. The chart box was sized at 100% of its section
  while starting below the section's header, so it overflowed the section
  and spilled onto the buttons.
- Dashboard widgets lost their saved settings on every page load — the
  Advanced Bot Stats bot selection (and its time-range choice) reset to
  empty after a refresh. The multi-dashboard store rehydrates from
  IndexedDB asynchronously, so before it finished the widget page treated
  "not loaded yet" as "no dashboards", fell back to the legacy dashboard
  store, and applied that store's default layout — whose orphaned-settings
  cleanup deleted the persisted settings of the real widgets.

## [2.39.10] - 2026-07-29

### Fixed

- The usage ring in a bot's Deals tab (table view) always read 0% for SHORT
  spot and COIN-M deals, even when orders had filled. The column derived the
  percentage from the quote-side usage figures, but those deals track usage on
  the base asset, so the ring stayed empty while the card view showed the real
  number. The table now uses the same strategy-aware usage percentage the card
  view and the Deals page already display.

## [2.39.9] - 2026-07-29

### Fixed

- Accumulated Profit showed a "Current Total" far below the real accumulated
  profit, and the 7D/30D/90D/All buttons only redrew the timeline without
  changing the period figures. The widget always asked the backend for daily
  profit, which is capped at the last 30 days, so every stat was really a
  30-day number: 90D and All padded the missing months with zeroes and reported
  a "Period Start" of $0. The widget now requests the bucket size that covers
  the selected range (daily, weekly, or monthly) and takes the headline total
  from the all-time profit aggregate, so "Current Total" is the true cumulative
  profit and "Period Start"/"Change" move with the selected range.
- Accumulated Profit scaled its figures by hardcoded per-exchange percentages
  left over from the widget's mock-data implementation.

## [2.39.8] - 2026-07-29

### Fixed

- "Tidy up" on the dashboard left large empty areas instead of filling them.
  A row whose next widget did not fit wrapped early and abandoned the remaining
  columns, leftover space was only shared proportionally (so a row holding a
  single widget kept its whole gap), and the widths the pass computed were
  discarded at render time because they were never recorded as the widget's
  size. Tidy up now looks ahead when filling a row, hands every unused column
  back to that row's widgets up to their maximum size, and stores the result so
  the grid draws it.
- "Tidy up" sized widgets for the wrong breakpoint on narrow desktop windows.
  It guessed the layout width from the window instead of measuring the grid, so
  a page with a scrollbar could be arranged for one breakpoint and drawn at
  another.

## [2.39.7] - 2026-07-29

### Removed

- Dead "best day" / "worst day" computation in the DCA bot drawer's profit
  metrics. The values were derived from backend stats but never rendered
  anywhere. Grid bots keep their Best Day / Worst Day tiles, which are computed
  separately in the frontend from the profit series.

## [2.39.6] - 2026-07-29

### Changed

- Advanced Bot Stats: Net Result, Avg Daily Return, and Max Equity Drawdown
  tiles use profit/loss colors; the Select Bots dialog is wider and long bot
  names truncate so the selection checkmark stays visible.

### Fixed

- Tables with a totals row (e.g. Portfolio Balances) no longer show a gap with
  clipped rows under the sticky totals row — the scroll container's bottom
  padding pushed the sticky row 16px above the table edge.

## [2.39.5] - 2026-07-29

### Changed

- Bot drawer: the Performance Chart and Deal Returns are now one **Performance**
  widget with a shared time axis and a 1M / 3M / ALL range selector that drives
  both panels. They previously had independent, self-scaled axes and different
  history depths (90 daily points vs. up to 500 closed deals), so a losing deal
  could sit plainly in the lower chart while being entirely off the left edge of
  the upper one — which is how a bot still recovering from a drawdown came to
  look purely profitable. Under ALL the upper panel simply starts where its
  daily history begins, leaving the earlier deals visible below it.

## [2.39.4] - 2026-07-29

### Changed

- Advanced Bot Stats: Profit chart is now green and Equity blue (previously
  swapped), and the stat tiles no longer show emoji icons.

## [2.39.3] - 2026-07-29

### Fixed

- Advanced Bot Stats: the Accumulated Profit / Equity chart now plots real USD
  series for the selected bots — the widget's data fetch never worked (it
  POSTed to a non-existent `/graphql` on the frontend origin), and the series
  it asked for was a per-deal ROI fraction, not an amount. It now aggregates
  each bot's `stats.chart` (the same real-currency series the bot drawer
  uses), forward-filling across bots so differently-timed deals sum correctly.
  Win Rate, Profit Factor, and Max Deal Duration tiles show real values
  instead of "—".
- News RSS widget loads again: of its three CORS relays, one service is dead,
  one was down, and the third (rss2json) was fetched and then discarded by a
  bug. rss2json responses are now parsed properly as a fallback, and the
  widget's Refresh button forces a re-fetch instead of silently hitting cache.
- Ready dashboard layouts (Trading Desk, Daily Briefing, Portfolio Deep Dive)
  no longer create empty, unremovable widget cells: the Quick Actions,
  Categories Analysis, and Exchange Distribution widget types were registered
  but never wired into the grid renderer. Any widget type that has no
  registered renderer now shows an explicit placeholder with a Remove button
  instead of an invisible cell.

## [2.39.2] - 2026-07-29

### Changed

- Bot Performance Chart: added a break-even line to the Realized Profit axis
  and a note that the chart covers the last 90 days and that Realized Profit is
  cumulative since the bot started. A bot older than 90 days opens the chart
  mid-history, so a line that starts below break-even and climbs was being read
  as pure profit with earlier losses missing.

## [2.39.1] - 2026-07-29

### Fixed

- The bot form's "More backtest settings" dialog opened on a hardcoded 1 hour /
  Auto instead of the candle timeframe and period picked in the quick-backtest
  bar, and ran the backtest on those defaults — so the bar's BACKTEST button and
  the dialog's START TEST produced different results from identical visible
  settings. The dialog now opens on the bar's timeframe and period.
- Selecting the "Auto" period in the backtest settings dialog no longer runs on
  the dates left over from a previously selected period; Auto again derives the
  window from the candle timeframe.

## [2.39.0] - 2026-07-29

### Fixed

- Billing history showed every row as a green `+amount`, so subscription
  purchases read as money coming in. Amounts are stored unsigned, so the sign
  now comes from the backend's `direction` classification: top-ups are `+`,
  purchases are `-`, and PayPal subscription renewals are neutral because they
  are charged to PayPal directly and never move the Gainium balance.

### Added

- Billing history has a Details column showing the payment's provider
  reference — the PayPal transaction id you can actually search for, the
  Bitcart invoice id, plus processor fee, net and any crypto discount. Rows
  that are internal wallet movements (plan-change credit, rewards conversion)
  no longer show a meaningless internal uuid, and are labelled for what they
  are instead of showing a raw source string like `bitcartcc`.

## [2.38.26] - 2026-07-29

### Changed

- Bot view, Deals section: clicking a deal (card or table row) now plots that
  deal's entry and exit on the chart instead of opening the deal details.
  Details are still one click away from the deal's "View Details" menu entry.
  On mobile and when the chart panel is collapsed — where there is no chart to
  draw on — clicking a deal still opens its details.

## [2.38.25] - 2026-07-28

### Fixed

- Tables no longer re-render each other. Every table shared a single
  preferences subscription, so changing the rows-per-page, view mode, sorting,
  search or column layout on one table re-rendered every other table on the
  page. Pages that stack several tables (bot view, portfolio, trading) now
  only redraw the table you actually touched. A table's own preference change
  also no longer hands its toolbar and controls a fresh set of callbacks,
  which was defeating their memoisation. Nothing changes about what is
  persisted or restored.

## [2.38.23] - 2026-07-28

### Fixed

- Paper top-up and the per-exchange balance refresh no longer hang for 30-40s:
  both now ask the backend to re-fetch only the affected exchange (new
  `updateBalance(uuid)` input; requires app-sh core >= 1.37.6, which also
  removes the snapshot's cross-exchange no-op write storm). "Refresh all"
  keeps the full refresh.

## [2.38.24] - 2026-07-28

### Fixed

- Charts, backtests and market stats now request each exchange's **native**
  pair symbol by default. Previously only a hand-maintained list of venues got
  the dashed pair (`BTC-USDT`) and everything else was sent the concatenated
  form; a venue missing from that list simply returned nothing, so the chart
  or backtest came back blank with no error. The rule is inverted: the dashed
  native pair is the default and only the venues that genuinely use the
  concatenated or contract form (Binance, Bybit, Bitget, MEXC, KuCoin futures,
  Binance COIN-M) are exempt. Newly added exchanges are now correct on day one
  instead of after an outage. This also fixes KuCoin spot (`kucoinSpot` /
  `kucoinAll`) and Kraken inverse futures pairs, which were never on the old
  list. When a symbol cannot be converted, a console warning now says so
  instead of failing silently.
- Coinbase charts now live-update again: the 30-second refresh polled with the
  concatenated pair, which Coinbase rejects as an invalid product id, so the
  last candle never moved after the initial load.
- KuCoin spot charts now live-tick: the websocket subscription asked for a
  symbol the exchange doesn't publish, so bars only updated on reload.
- OKX charts now live-tick with the RIGHT market's prices: the subscription
  both used a symbol OKX doesn't publish and — for perpetual accounts —
  resolved to the spot instrument; perp charts now subscribe to the `-SWAP`
  instrument.
- Server-side backtests on dashed-pair exchanges (Hyperliquid, Kraken, OKX,
  Coinbase, KuCoin spot) now find their candles. The pair sent to the
  backtester is taken from the exchange's own pair metadata (preserving
  case-sensitive symbols like Kraken's tokenized stocks `AAPLx-USD` and
  irregular ids like OKX's `BTC-USD_UM_XPERP`), falling back to the chart's
  converter only when metadata is missing.
- Pair splitting recognises the `USDH`, `USDE`, `USDS` and `USDG` quotes and
  always matches the longest quote first.

## [2.38.21] - 2026-07-28

### Fixed

- Accounts with no saved dashboards no longer log "Failed to initialize
  default widgets" (twice, via StrictMode) on /dashboard: the small-screen
  (sm/xs/xxs) default layouts still referenced the removed
  `technical-indicator-heatmap` widget, and hitting it aborted default-widget
  setup for the whole page. The dead entry is gone, and the default /
  screen-adjusted layout builders now skip widget types not registered in the
  current build (e.g. cloud-only widgets on self-hosted) — same policy as
  dashboard templates — instead of failing outright.

## [2.38.20] - 2026-07-28

### Fixed

- Hyperliquid candle requests from the bot form, backtests and market stats
  now send the dashed pair (`BTC-USDC`) the exchange actually lists instead of
  the concatenated internal form (`BTCUSDC`), which the backend could never
  resolve — those flows showed no candles on Hyperliquid, and each attempt
  burnt ~90s of retries server-side. Saved-bot charts were
  unaffected.
- Hyperliquid charts now have their own data handler. They previously fell
  back to the Binance chart handler, whose live-update stream subscribes to
  Binance's WebSocket — a Hyperliquid chart could silently tick with Binance
  prices for lookalike symbols. Live updates now poll Gainium's own candle
  endpoint, and an unregistered exchange reaching the Binance fallback is
  logged.

## [2.38.19] - 2026-07-28

### Fixed

- Webhook payloads in the bot editor, the bot drawer and the webhook
  configuration modal now carry the bot's real webhook UUID instead of its
  internal database id. Copying a sample payload and firing it at
  `/trade_signal` previously matched no bot, so the signal was silently
  ignored — start/stop bot, open/close deal, add/reduce funds and change pairs
  all did nothing. The legacy dashboard always sent the correct value.

## [2.38.18] - 2026-07-28

### Fixed

- "Duplicate bot" in the bot editor's overflow menu now opens the pre-filled
  create page instead of immediately saving a copy. The duplicate's trading
  pair and exchange stay editable until you press Create — previously the copy
  was created straight away and landed on its edit page, where the pair of a
  single-pair bot can never be changed. Clone from the bot list already worked
  this way; the editor menu was the last place that didn't.
- The trading pair of an existing single-pair DCA, Combo or Grid bot is now
  shown read-only, with a note explaining how to move the strategy to another
  pair. It previously looked editable and reported "Bot updated successfully!",
  but the pair silently reverted — the backend rejects pair changes on
  non-multi bots. Multi-pair bots are unaffected and stay editable.

## [2.38.17] - 2026-07-27

### Fixed

- Connecting or removing an exchange now updates the onboarding checklist and
  the "no exchanges yet" empty states immediately, instead of leaving them on
  the previous state until the next full page load. Same root cause as the
  trading-mode revert in 2.38.16: the locally-kept copy of the profile was
  never refreshed after the change.
- Marking notifications or changelog entries as read no longer re-downloads the
  exchange, backtest and market-data caches as a side effect.

### Changed

- Removed the dead React Query cache operations against the `['exchanges']` key
  in the exchange mutations. No query has ever owned that key — the exchange
  list is cached under `['user', …]` — so the invalidations and the optimistic
  `setQueryData` blocks were no-ops. The `['user']` invalidations and the
  `useExchangesStore` updates, which are what actually refresh the UI, are
  unchanged. Internal cleanup, no behavior change.

## [2.38.16] - 2026-07-27

### Fixed

- Switching to Live trading no longer reverts to Paper after a page reload.
  The mode a user picks is written to their profile on the server, but the
  copy of that profile the app keeps locally was never updated — so the next
  reload restored the previous mode, and the one after that flipped it back,
  which read as the toggle randomly resetting itself. The saved profile now
  moves with the toggle, and a profile that genuinely changed (including a
  switch made on another device) is still applied instead of being ignored
  for the rest of the session.

## [2.38.15] - 2026-07-27

### Fixed

- Multi-select table filters (exchange, status, strategy, and numeric/date
  "between" ranges) no longer break when the page reloads — for example after
  pressing the `B` navigation shortcut while already on Trading Bots. Selecting
  two or more values collapsed them into one comma-joined string in the URL, so
  the reloaded list matched nothing and looked like the filters had been reset.
  Most visible in paper trading, where several paper accounts are typically
  selected at once.

## [2.38.14] - 2026-07-27

### Fixed

- The app now honours the browser's font-size setting everywhere. Text was
  sized in absolute pixels while every container, gap and sidebar width scaled
  with the browser's setting, so anyone who had changed it (Chrome →
  Appearance → Font size) got boxes that no longer matched their text —
  overflowing and truncating labels, with page zoom unable to help because it
  scales both sides at once. Text and layout are now on the same scale, so the
  app simply renders larger or smaller as a whole. Rendering is unchanged for
  anyone on the default 16px, and the in-app font-size setting is unaffected.

## [2.38.13] - 2026-07-27

### Fixed

- Pair/coin picker: rows were unreadable — the pair name squeezed down to a
  sliver next to its ROI / 24h chips, and the search placeholder clipped — for
  anyone whose browser font size isn't the 16px default (Chrome's Appearance →
  Font size, or a minimum-font-size setting). The dialog was sized in `rem`
  (browser font size) while all its text is sized from `--base-font-size`, so
  the two drifted apart and the pair name, as the only flexible cell, absorbed
  the whole shortfall. The dialog now scales with the same setting its text
  does, rows reflow based on the dialog's own width, and the name keeps a
  readable minimum.

### Changed

- Pair/coin picker: the dialog now widens on larger screens instead of staying
  at a fixed 26rem, so more of each pair's name and metrics is visible.

## [2.38.12] - 2026-07-27

### Changed

- Trading terminal: the Amount and Total order-size fields now use the same funds control as the bot forms, so both show the funding wallet's balance with a refresh button instead of a bare number box. The percentage row, the canonical-unit lock and the max hints are unchanged.
- Trading terminal: Quick mode no longer shows a Bot Name field or generates a name for the order — matching Manual mode, which never had one.
- Grid bot form: the manual Investment field gains the same balance readout and refresh control the quick setup already had.

### Fixed

- Trading terminal: a base amount derived from the Total no longer displays as `0` on pairs with a coarse lot step (a 10 USDT total on a 0.001-step futures pair read "0 BTC" instead of 0.00015318). The exchange step still rounds the value that gets ordered; it no longer rounds the readout.
- Trading terminal: with no price loaded — the pair query failing, or nothing selected yet — the derived field now shows nothing instead of echoing the other field's figure in the wrong unit (a 10 USDT total rendered as "10 BTC").
- Bot forms: the shared funds input now honors `disabled`/`readOnly`, so a locked or variable-bound order size can no longer be typed into.

## [2.38.11] - 2026-07-27

### Fixed

- Bot form: pairs whose exchange symbol is not simply base + quote — Binance COIN-M (`BTCUSD_PERP`), dated futures (`BTCUSDT_260925`, `BTCUSDT-25SEP26`) and USDC perpetuals (`BTCPERP`, `BTCUSDU26`) on Bybit, Bitget and KuCoin — are now identified by their exchange symbol instead of a rebuilt `BASE+QUOTE`. Previously the chart showed "No data here" or silently plotted a different contract (the perpetual instead of the dated future), selecting such a pair left the chart on the previous one, and the pair label rendered as nonsense (`BTCUSD_P/ERP`).
- Bot form: the pair picker no longer hides contracts that share a base and quote. Every expiry of a market collapsed onto a single row, so 10 of 30 Binance COIN-M pairs and 36 of 760 Bybit linear pairs were unreachable.

## [2.38.10] - 2026-07-27

### Fixed

- Bot form: after "Reset to defaults", a bot form on a futures exchange no longer silently reverts to spot behavior. The Order Size Reference and Margin & Leverage rows stayed hidden (and the spot-only Profit Currency row appeared) because the derived futures/coin-m flags were only ever set when the selected exchange changed; they are now kept in sync with the exchange.

## [2.38.9] - 2026-07-27

### Fixed

- Charts: recently listed pairs no longer render a permanently empty chart ("No data here", `O∅ H∅ L∅ C∅`). When the requested window started before the market existed, the candle loader stopped at the first empty range and threw away the whole load; it now skips the leading pre-listing gap and returns the candles that do exist.

## [2.38.8] - 2026-07-26

### Fixed

- DCA bot form: switching the DCA type tab away from Indicators (or Custom) and back no longer clears the configuration — the indicator list and custom DCA rows now survive the round-trip in both directions.
- DCA bot form: "Add DCA Indicator" now starts from a copy of the previous start-DCA indicator (type, parameters, minimum % from last order, order size) instead of resetting to RSI defaults. Only the first indicator falls back to defaults.
- Indicator settings: fields gated on another field's value now respect that field's default, so the Moving Average Ratio "Comparison MA length" input is hidden while Reference is "Current price" instead of lingering above "Relative to".

## [2.38.7] - 2026-07-26

### Fixed

- Bot chart: the page no longer crashes to the error screen when the chart is rebuilt while live data is still arriving — changing the pair or timeframe, or navigating away mid-update, could take down the whole Grid bot edit page. Average-price lines, indicators and the position overlay now wait for the new chart instead.

## [2.38.6] - 2026-07-25

### Removed

- DCA and Combo bot settings: the "Volume based on" control and its "Required change" mode are gone from the bot form. Safety-order volume is always scaled, which is what the DCA overview table and graph already project — use volume and volume scale to shape the ladder. The dependent fields ("Required changed based on", "Required change", "Max volume per DCA", and the required-change order size reference) go with it. Existing bots keep the settings they were saved with.

## [2.38.5] - 2026-07-25

### Fixed

- Saved backtesting periods are stored on your account again instead of only in the browser, so periods created in the previous dashboard — or on another browser or device — show up in the backtest settings. Periods that only existed locally are uploaded once on first load.
- The backtest run that creates a new saved period now records that period's name, so it no longer appears as `N/A` in the Testing Period Name column of the backtest list.
- Client-side backtests now show the saved period's name in the Testing Period Name column. The name was stored correctly on the server but the browser's local copy of the result — which takes precedence in the list — was written without it, so every client-side run displayed `N/A`.

## [2.38.3] - 2026-07-24

### Fixed

- Quick bot setup: editing the auto-filled bot name no longer snaps back to the generated value when the form re-renders (market data settling, switching the strategy preset). A name you type is now kept, including edits that leave the trailing preset and date in place.

### Changed

- Quick bot setup: auto-generated bot names now always include the bot type (e.g. `BTCUSDT Hedge DCA Balanced 2026-07-24`, `BTCUSDT DCA 2026-07-24`) — Hedge DCA/Combo previously omitted it. The strategy preset, when one is selected, follows the bot type.

## [2.38.2] - 2026-07-23

### Changed

- Take Profit & Stop Loss: selecting "Dynamic ATR/ADR" now auto-adds a default ATR indicator when none is configured (matches the legacy dashboard), instead of showing an "Add an ATR or ADR indicator" error.

## [2.38.1] - 2026-07-23

### Fixed

- Take Profit → Dynamic ATR/ADR: configured ATR/ADR indicators are now saved with the bot — previously they vanished after saving and reopening the editor ("No ATR/ADR indicators configured"). The same fix applies to Stop Loss in Dynamic ATR/ADR mode.
- Take Profit → Dynamic ATR/ADR: editing the indicator's Length (and Interval) no longer snaps back to the previous value.
- Risk:Reward: editing an indicator's parameters in the inline config no longer snaps back to the previous value.

## [2.38.0] - 2026-07-23

### Added

- Settings → Login & Security: Discord can now be enabled/disabled as a login method, like the other methods (cloud). Discord-minted sessions are labeled in the sessions list.

## [2.37.0] - 2026-07-23

### Added

- Dedicated sign-up page at /signup (cloud): create an account with Google, Discord, or an email link — no password needed. The login page links to it ("Don't have an account? Sign up"), and /register redirects there.
- Discord sign-in/sign-up (cloud): new "Continue with Discord" option on the login and sign-up pages, with a dedicated /auth/discord callback. Enabled when VITE_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID is configured.

### Changed

- Login page redesigned: each sign-in method is a full-width row (Google, Discord, passkey, email link) with even spacing; the Google button now matches the app's button style instead of the Google-rendered widget; clearer headings on login and sign-up.
- The passkey button now explains via tooltip that terms must be accepted first.

## [2.36.3] - 2026-07-23

### Changed

- Login page: the email-link option now says "Sign in or sign up with email" and explains that the same link creates an account for new users — no Google account or password needed. The "check your inbox" confirmation mentions sign-up too.

## [2.36.2] - 2026-07-21

### Changed

- OKX exchange form: choosing the OKX Europe origin (my.okx.com) now switches the account to spot-only, since EU accounts have no supported futures product. The existing OKX Europe notice explains the restriction.

### Fixed

- Bot forms (DCA/Grid): OKX Europe futures accounts (leftover Linear/Inverse sub-accounts) are hidden from the exchange picker, so EU users land on their tradeable USDC/EUR spot account instead of an unusable USDT-only futures account.

## [2.36.1] - 2026-07-20

### Fixed

- Bot drawer deals table: open deals on a symbol that isn't in the bot's `settings.pair` (e.g. a pair the user removed while a deal stayed open) no longer show "Price unavailable" for unrealized P&L. Fees are now fetched for the union of `settings.pair` and every displayed deal symbol — matching the Overview/positions view — so the client-side P&L can be computed for those deals.

## [2.36.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- Restore action for canceled deals: canceled DCA and Terminal deals now have a "Restore" option in the deal actions menu that re-activates the deal as a bare position — adopting its existing holdings with no DCA, take profit or stop loss. The confirmation states this. Shown only on canceled DCA and Terminal deals (no other bot types or statuses). Requires the matching `restoreDeal` backend support.

## [2.35.9] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- Hedge DCA and Hedge Combo bot tables now show a totals row for Cost, Max cost, Total profit and Unrealized PnL (summed) and Avg daily (averaged), matching the DCA, Combo and Grid tables. The aggregation for each column can be switched (Sum/Average/Min/Max) and is remembered.

## [2.35.8] - 2026-07-20

### Fixed

- Importing bot settings whose "name" is a number (via Import / Export settings) no longer crashes the new-bot Quick form — the name is now safely coerced to text instead of throwing.

## [2.35.7] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- Hedge DCA and Hedge Combo bot tables now show a Usage column (filled value vs. max value), matching the DCA, Combo, and legacy dashboard bot tables.

## [2.35.6] - 2026-07-20

### Fixed

- New-bot form no longer forces Profit Currency to "base" on spot and USDⓈ-M (linear) exchanges — it now defaults to "quote" and only uses "base" for inverse (coin-m) exchanges, matching the legacy dashboard.
- New-bot form reliably reflects the selected exchange's market type, so the futures-only controls (Order Size Reference, Margin & Leverage) show up on futures exchanges instead of occasionally staying hidden after a form reset.

## [2.35.5] - 2026-07-20

### Changed

- Pressing a page's navigation keyboard shortcut while already on that page now refreshes the page instead of doing nothing.

## [2.35.4] - 2026-07-20

### Changed

- Renamed the Combo bot's "Base grid step (%)" and "DCA grid step (%)" fields to "Base grid range (%)" and "DCA grid range (%)". The value has always been the grid's total span (split across the levels), not the per-level step — the derived per-level spacing is still shown below each field. No change to bot behavior.

## [2.35.3] - 2026-07-20

### Changed

- Data tables now remember your totals-row aggregation choice (Total, Average, Min, Max) per column between sessions, alongside the already-saved filters and sorting.

## [2.35.2] - 2026-07-17

### Fixed

- A slow or failed connection while opening a bot no longer makes the app think the bot is missing — it could switch your Live/Paper toggle on its own, or wrongly report a healthy bot as not found.

## [2.35.1] - 2026-07-17

### Fixed

- Bot view pages no longer crash to "Something went wrong" when a bot's paper/live mode differs from the active trading mode. The page now switches to the bot's real mode once instead of flipping back and forth until the page gave up.

## [2.35.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- **Active sessions** section in Login & Security: see every device and browser signed in to your account (device, approximate location, IP, login method and sign-in time), log out an individual session, or log out all other sessions at once.

## [2.34.1] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- Each backtest in the backtests list now has an **Export** option in its row action menu, so a single backtest can be exported without first selecting it. Available for DCA, Combo, and Grid backtests. The option is enabled only for locally-stored backtests (those with a full local payload to export); server-only backtests show it disabled. The exported JSON file is named after the backtest (`<name>_<TYPE>_<date>.json`).

### Changed

- Backtest export is now JSON only; the CSV export option was removed (single-row menu and bulk action).
- Backtest export reads the complete backtest from local storage, so locally-run backtests export their full, re-importable data.

## [2.34.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- New `settings.savedData` extension slot on the Settings page, letting a host build mount a data-management section. The cloud dashboard fills it with the **Saved Data** manager (export/import of local data — rulebooks, trade journal, chart layouts, cached candles, saved backtests — plus remote backtests). The section is host-gated, so self-hosted builds that register no filler don't surface an empty tab.

## [2.33.18] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- Combo and DCA deal details now show an **Auto-Compounding** breakdown. For each order — the initial buy and every DCA safety order — it lists the configured size, the amount auto-compounding added on top, and the resulting effective size. The dashboard already fetched this data but never displayed it, so there was no way to see how much compounding contributed to a deal; this restores the visibility the legacy dashboard had.

## [2.33.17] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed

- Opening a grid or DCA bot's edit page no longer freezes the tab on cold load. When the detailed-settings query hadn't resolved yet and the form fell back to basic bot data, that fallback was rebuilt as a fresh object on every render, defeating the downstream memoization and spinning the bot form into an infinite re-render loop that pegged the browser. The fallback is now memoized, so the edit page mounts and settles normally.

## [2.33.16] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed

- Editing a grid bot whose exchange is missing or invalid no longer crashes the bot form. The pair-metadata effect could rewrite an empty value on every render, spinning the form into an infinite re-render loop (React error #185) and taking down the edit page. It now seeds pair metadata only on initial mount, so the form loads and recovers instead of crashing.

## [2.33.15] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed

- Backtests on Bybit (and any exchange whose candle endpoint returns partial history on a cold cache) no longer run on incomplete data. Fine-timeframe candle loading could silently drop the head of each fetched window, leaving large interior gaps — a Bybit run could cover as little as ~25% of the period while the identical Binance run covered 100%, making the same strategy look drastically worse on Bybit. The candle loader now detects residual gaps in the assembled series and refills them, so backtests replay the full period on every exchange. Contiguous series (the common case) are unaffected.

## [2.33.14] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed

- A slow or unreachable backend no longer leaves data widgets spinning indefinitely. Interactive data reads across every main page (Overview, Portfolio, the bot/combo/grid pages, Terminal, and the new bot/grid/combo forms) now fail fast with a clear "request timed out" message after 30 seconds instead of pending until the ~5-minute server cutoff. Genuinely long reads — full-history profit charts, backtest-result lists, and archived (cold-store) bot lists — get a more generous 60-second cap, while backtest runs stay uncapped. Timed-out reads no longer silently retry three times before surfacing the error, and the REST-backed widgets (market screener, curated presets, price tickers) gained the same protection.

## [2.33.13] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed

- Dashboard chart widgets: switching a timeframe/range now updates the selected chip and chart immediately instead of appearing frozen for several seconds. Affected every widget backed by a persisted setting (Profit over time's Daily/Weekly/Monthly/Total, Portfolio Value's 1M/3M/12M). The persisted-setting hook had stopped subscribing to its own stored value (a regression from the 2.32.17 re-render cleanup, which switched the store access to method selectors), so clicking a chip wrote the new value but re-rendered nothing — the widget only repainted later when an unrelated update (a socket tick or the minute clock) happened to flush a render. Restored a precise per-setting subscription so the owning widget re-renders the instant its own setting changes.

## [2.33.12] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed

- A slow or unreachable backend no longer destroys the session or hangs the app at boot. Opening the dashboard while the API was degraded used to show a full-screen "Loading…" for minutes (boot token validation had no timeout, so the request pended until the ~5-minute server cutoff) and then kick the user to the login page even though their session was perfectly valid (every failure — timeout, network error, 5xx — was treated as "invalid token" and wiped the stored session). Boot now restores the session instantly from the last known state and validates it in the background with a 15-second cap; only an actual server-side rejection (revoked token, deleted user, 401/403) logs the user out, while network failures and server errors keep the session and retry on the next boot.

## [2.33.11] - 2026-07-16

### Removed

- Dropped the global Binance Quantitative Rules cooldown banner and its per-page `getQuantRulesStatus` poll. The cooldown is already surfaced once per window as a bot message (notification bell + toast) over the existing live socket, so the dedicated banner and its own polling request were redundant.

## [2.33.10] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed

- Reverted the `useDeferredValue` experiment on the Portfolio Value chart (2.33.9) — it made the chip selection lag/freeze instead of updating. Chip range switches are client-side and fast (~2ms compute); the chart uses `timeFilter` directly and the loading spinner shows only during an actual (re)fetch (initial load / filter change). Chips still work on the portfolio page (fixedTimeframe lock removed in 2.33.9).

## [2.33.9] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed

- Portfolio page: the 1M/3M/12M chips were inert (locked to 1M) — the page wrapped the chart with a `fixedTimeframe`, which forced the range back on every click. Removed, so the chips work on the portfolio page too. Chips are now hidden entirely when a fixed timeframe is intentionally set (instead of rendering non-functional).
- Portfolio Value chart: switching a chip now updates the selected chip **instantly** and shows a loading spinner on the chart while it redraws, instead of the chip appearing frozen until the redraw finishes (`useDeferredValue` splits the urgent chip highlight from the deferred chart render).

## [2.33.8] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed

- Portfolio Value chart: switching time chips (1M/3M/12M) is now instant. The chart fetches the full 12-month range **once** and the chips filter the loaded series client-side, instead of re-fetching from the backend on every switch (which caused a multi-second loading delay). For the default all-coins/all-exchanges view it also requests a lean `updateTime+totalUsd` payload (no per-day asset breakdown), pulling assets only when a coin/exchange filter is active — so the one initial fetch stays small.

## [2.33.7] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed

- Portfolio Value chart no longer draws a line up from $0 to the first value. Accounts funded later have a run of $0 snapshots at the start of their history; the chart now trims those leading empty points and starts at the first funded value. Interior/trailing $0 (real drawdowns) are unaffected.

## [2.33.6] - 2026-07-16

### Changed

- Portfolio Value chart time chips are now **1M / 3M / 12M** (was 30D / 60D / 90D). The chart fetches the whole selected range from the backend instead of only the last 30 days, so the longer ranges actually show more history. Legacy persisted 30/60/90 selections migrate to the new chips.

## [2.33.5] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed

- Deal action menu: for deals that are no longer open (cancelled, closed), Add Funds, Reduce Funds, Edit, Cancel and Close are now greyed out — matching how Change DCA levels and Move to Terminal already behaved. Applies to the trade cards, the bot drawer deals table and the open-orders widget.

## [2.33.4] - 2026-07-16

### Changed

- Auto-archive notices now show as info messages, visually distinct from warnings and errors. The bot error/warning banner renders an `info` severity with a calm blue Info icon and neutral tone instead of the amber warning style.

## [2.33.3] - 2026-07-15

### Changed

- Bot creation/editing forms: extended the per-keystroke re-render cleanup to more sections. The Basic (name/exchange/pair), Deal Start, Risk/Reward and Webhook sections now read their data from the form store directly, so typing in one field no longer re-renders those sections. Applies across DCA, Grid, Combo and Hedge forms (including Quick mode and hedge legs).

## [2.33.2] - 2026-07-15

### Changed

- Bot creation/editing forms: typing in a field (bot name, take-profit %, etc.) is smoother. The form no longer re-renders unrelated sections or re-runs the pair/exchange lookup on every keystroke — a chunk of per-keystroke work has been removed from the Take Profit section and the shared form data layer. Applies to DCA, Grid, Combo and Hedge forms.

## [2.33.1] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- Bot details drawer: the Deals tab now shows a "Loading deals…" indicator while open/closed deals are being fetched, instead of flashing "No trades found" / an empty table. The same indicator is used for every bot type (DCA, Combo, Grid and Hedge DCA/Combo).
- Bot details drawer: deals now render incrementally as each page arrives, so large bots (thousands of closed deals) show their first deals within a couple of seconds instead of blocking on the full multi-page fetch. Applies to all bot types.
- Bot details drawer: the deals table footer count no longer stays stuck at "0-0 (0)" when deals load asynchronously — it now reflects the actual number of loaded and total deals (e.g. "1-10 (15,418)"). This also fixes the row count/pagination label on other data tables that populate after mount.

## [2.33.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- Hedge DCA and Hedge Combo bot pages now have a "Show Archived" toggle and an archived-bots view, matching the Trading/Grid/Combo pages. Archive a stopped hedge bot from its row/card menu, view your archived hedge bots via the toggle, and un-archive to bring one back to the active list. The archived list is isolated from the live-bots store, so opening an archived bot's deals no longer flips the background list to your active bots.

### Fixed

- Hedge bot lists (`useHedgeDcaBots`/`useHedgeComboBots`) no longer let a live/active refetch clobber the archived view. The archived query now reads and writes its own isolated result instead of the shared bot store — same isolation already applied to the DCA/Grid/Combo lists.

## [2.32.21] - 2026-07-15

### Changed

- Live-update context: hoisted the store-selector groups to module scope, dropping 28 render-time selector subscriptions and shrinking the context-value dependency list. Live bot stats, orders, balances, deals, and messages update exactly as before — this only removes redundant subscription bookkeeping per provider mount.
- Dashboard Bot Status and Latest Orders widgets: collapsed the redundant wrapper-props container memos now that the widget wrapper is memoized. No visible change; the wrapper's re-render behavior is unchanged.

## [2.32.20] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- Bot list pages (DCA and Combo): a live-stats update for one bot no longer re-renders every card in the list. Each card now keeps its data unless that specific bot changed, so the grid stays smooth while stats stream in on accounts with many bots.

## [2.32.19] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- Bot list pages (DCA, Grid, Combo, Hedge DCA, Hedge Combo): the empty-state message now renders inside the table area instead of replacing the whole table, so the toolbar — including the Archived toggle — stays visible when you have no active bots. Previously, an account with zero active bots hid the Archived switch, making archived bots unreachable.

## [2.32.18] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- CSV export from any table (portfolio, trades, deals, etc.) now quotes and escapes every value, so cells containing commas, quotes, or line breaks no longer shift columns or split one row across several lines. Exporting a bot's closed deals previously produced roughly twice as many lines as deals; the file now round-trips cleanly through spreadsheet apps and CSV parsers.

## [2.32.17] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- Idle CPU/battery drain: the dashboard re-rendered the entire app about 4 times per second while sitting idle (widget staleness timers plus a provider-chain subscription cascade). Idle render work is now ~99% lower; live data still updates as before.
- Bot create/edit form input lag: typing in any field re-rendered every form section (~250 ms per keystroke on large forms). Keystrokes now re-render only what changed (~10× fewer render passes, roughly half the input latency), and validation/order-preview updates are debounced without starving during rapid input or stepper holds.
- Live-data widgets (bot stats, open orders, messages, portfolio balances) now subscribe to their live stores directly, so socket updates keep reaching them; previously they refreshed only as a side effect of unrelated app re-renders.
- Time-windowed charts keep sliding while the dashboard stays open: the portfolio value window and the daily profit rollover no longer freeze at their initial load time.
- Widget settings could be saved into the wrong widget's namespace after a widget id changed in place (e.g. workbench mode switch).

## [2.32.16] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- Trading Bots list loads much faster for accounts with many bots: the list query no longer ships per-bot time-series arrays and per-symbol stats that nothing in the list reads (cards, table and drawer stream live stats via websocket; the single-bot drawer query still fetches everything), roughly halving the response for large accounts.
- The bot list no longer fetches twice on a cold start: the paper-to-live trading-mode settle used to re-fire the heavy list query under both contexts back to back; it now waits until the mode matches the profile and fires exactly once.

## [2.32.15] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- Deals table export (CSV/JSON) in the bot details drawer now downloads every deal by fetching the complete set from the server. Previously it silently exported only the rows the table had loaded — bots with many closed deals (or a partially-loaded table) exported a small subset.
- The deals table pagination footer now shows "loaded of total" (e.g. "1-10 (400 of 970)") when the table holds only part of a larger closed-deals set, instead of implying the loaded rows are everything.

## [2.32.14] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- Grid bots now show live order-placement progress. While the bot places its grid ladder the settings form is replaced by a progress bar (current stage / total), and the orders appear on the chart one-by-one as they are placed. The form stays locked until every order is placed. Restores the behavior from the legacy dashboard.

### Fixed

- Changing a grid bot's pair (for example after cloning one) now recomputes the price range to ±10% of the new pair's current price. Previously the range kept the source pair's values — e.g. a BTC bot's ~50,000 bounds carried onto an ADA pair trading near 0.16 — producing an out-of-scale grid that failed on start with repeated "not enough balance" errors on the sell orders.

## [2.32.13] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed

- The deal edit drawer no longer resets your in-progress changes when new deal notifications arrive. Realtime deal updates can no longer re-seed the form while you're editing it; the form only re-initializes when you open a different deal.

## [2.32.12] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed

- Viewing an archived bot's Closed deals no longer flips the background bot list back to your active bots. The archived list (Trading / Grid / Combo) is now isolated from the shared live-bots store, so when the detail drawer's widgets refetch active bots they can't overwrite what the archived list shows. The "Show Archived" toggle stays on and the list keeps showing your archived bots throughout.

## [2.32.11] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed

- Cloning a combo or grid bot from its detail drawer now opens the create form pre-filled with the bot's settings (so you can change the pair/exchange before saving), matching how cloning a trading bot already worked. Previously combo/grid clone from the drawer immediately created a copy without opening it, leaving the pair unchangeable.
- Cloning a paper trading bot no longer fails with "Bot not found" — the new-bot page now fetches the source bot in the same paper/live context it lives in (it previously always looked in live).
- Cloning a bot now opens the create form in Manual mode, so the cloned strategy is shown as-is instead of being overwritten by a Quick-mode risk profile. Applies to every bot type.

### Changed

- Bot actions (start/stop, restart, clone, delete, plus their confirmation and success modals) are now driven by one shared `useBotActions` hook + `BotActionsModals` component instead of each surface hand-rolling its own handlers and modals. Every bot surface — the trading/grid/hedge cards, the detail drawer, and the Trading/Combo/Grid/Hedge list-row menus — routes through it, so an action behaves identically everywhere. Hedge start/stop now goes through the same status-toggle path as every other bot type (retiring a duplicated inline implementation).

## [2.32.10] - 2026-07-14

### Changed

- All bot list pages (Trading / Grid / Combo / Hedge Combo / Hedge DCA) now resolve the detail-drawer bot through one shared `useDrawerBot` hook instead of each page hand-rolling its own logic. The hook owns list lookup, the by-id fallback that keeps archived (and shared) bots viewable, the sticky-through-refetch behavior that prevents the drawer flickering/remounting when the list refetches in the background, and the not-found redirect signal — so this behavior is fixed once for every bot type. Also gives hedge bot pages the by-id fallback they previously lacked.

## [2.32.9] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed

- Opening a bot's detail drawer no longer flickers/remounts (which reset the Deals sub-tab back to Open and briefly flashed the bots list) when the bots list refetches in the background. The drawer resolves its bot from the live list, which momentarily empties during a websocket-driven refetch; the resolved bot is now "sticky" for the current selection so the drawer stays mounted. Most visible when viewing an archived bot's closed deals.

## [2.32.8] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed

- Un-archiving from a bot's detail drawer (and the list row menus) now actually un-archives. The archive toggle checked `status === 'archived'`, but the real status is `archive`, so on an archived bot it computed "not archived" and re-archived instead of un-archiving. Now matches both spellings (drawer + Trading/Grid/Combo pages).
- Archived bots no longer show Start / Restart / Edit in the detail drawer's footer (they can't be started or edited until un-archived — use Unarchive in the ⋯ menu). The footer bar is hidden entirely when it would be empty.

## [2.32.7] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed

- Un-archiving a bot now makes it reappear in the bots list immediately. Archiving records a client-side tombstone (to block stale replays); un-archive now clears that tombstone, so the returning bot is no longer filtered out — previously the list could show empty after un-archiving your only bot.

### Changed

- The bots-list empty state is now archive-aware and never a dead end: with archived bots hidden it offers a "View archived bots" link, and the archived view shows "No archived bots" with a "Back to active bots" action. Applies to Trading/Grid/Combo lists.

## [2.32.6] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed

- Archived bots now show the correct actions menu: the toggle reads **Unarchive** (previously showed "Archive" because the label only matched the `archived` spelling, not the actual `archive` status), and **Start**, **Restart** and **Edit** are hidden for archived bots (an archived bot can't be started or edited — un-archive it first).

## [2.32.5] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed

- Archiving a bot no longer shows a confirmation dialog — it archives directly (archiving is reversible via un-archive). Archive is now handled centrally in the shared bot actions menu (`BotActionsMenuItems`), so the Archive action works from every surface, including bot cards where it previously did nothing.
- Opening an **archived** bot's detail/deals no longer redirects to the bots list. Archived bots are filtered out of the default list, so the drawer couldn't resolve them; it now fetches the selected bot by id (shared `useSharedBot` fallback) and its trades load from cold storage in the drawer's existing open/closed deals tabs — no navigation.

### Changed

- Removed the per-page archive confirmation dialog and its duplicated wiring across the bot pages (Trading/Grid/Combo/BotForm/BotDetailsDrawer); the shared menu owns the archive action.

## [2.32.4] - 2026-07-14

### Changed

- Cold-store archive UX now reflects that archiving is **reversible**. The archive confirmation dialog says archiving moves the bot's history to cold storage and can be undone by un-archiving (was "read-only / clone to reuse / can't be undone"). Cold-archived bots no longer disable their Unarchive action — un-archiving restores the history. Still gated on `VITE_COLD_STORE_ENABLED` (dark until rollout).

## [2.32.3] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed

- Archiving a bot from the bot detail/view page (`/…/view/:id`) now works. The view-page action menu never wired its Archive action, so clicking Archive there did nothing; it now archives (and shows the read-only warning when the cold-store UX is enabled), matching the bot-list menus.

## [2.32.2] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed

- Notification sounds now actually play when you turn on "Enable sounds". Previously that master switch was a no-op unless you had also enabled a per-type sound on the Settings page (all off by default), so it looked broken. Turning it on now seeds the default deal/order sounds, and enabling any per-type sound automatically un-mutes the master. Added a matching "Notification sounds" master switch to Settings → Notification Preferences so its state is visible where sounds are configured.

## [2.32.1] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed

- Order/deal price displays now show adaptive decimal precision for sub-$1 "penny" coins. Prices like DOGE render `$0.07120` (and smaller coins get more significant digits) instead of collapsing to `$0.07`, in the deal orders list, bot drawer orders table, and trade detail. Prices ≥ 1 are unchanged.

## [2.32.0] - 2026-07-12

### Added

- Bot details drawer: show a dismissible alert when a running bot has logged error or warning events, with a link that jumps to the bot's Events tab. Dismissing it clears the flag. Mirrors the error/warning notice the legacy dashboard showed.

## [2.31.1] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- Extend the archive read-only warning to the bot edit page's Archive action (previously only the bot-list menus warned). Same flag gate (`VITE_COLD_STORE_ENABLED`).

## [2.31.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- Archiving a bot now warns that archived bots become read-only (a new confirmation on the Grid/DCA/Combo bot menus): the trade history is preserved but the bot can't be started again — clone it to reuse. Cold-store (read-only) archived bots also hide their un-archive action. Ships behind `VITE_COLD_STORE_ENABLED` (off by default) in lock-step with the backend cold-store rollout.

## [2.30.32] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed

- Bots on dash-separated exchanges (Coinbase, Kraken, OKX, KuCoin) with a non-USD quote asset (e.g. a SOL/EUR grid) no longer show a Current Funds value of $0.00 and a wildly wrong Total P&L. The USD-rate lookup only matched concatenated ticker symbols (`EURUSDT`), so it never found a USD bridge for exchanges whose symbols use a separator (`USDT-EUR`), returning a rate of 0. It now matches all separator forms, so current-funds value, Total P&L, and unrealized PnL are correct. Also fixes the USDT→USD leg for every exchange.

## [2.30.31] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed

- DCA / Combo / Futures bots: Risk:Reward settings can be saved again. Enabling Risk:Reward and picking a stop-loss indicator failed with "At least one indicator is required when Risk:Reward is enabled" (and silently dropped every risk setting on edit), because the indicator lookup collected a single match but then required an array. It now collects all matching indicators, so the whole Risk:Reward configuration round-trips correctly on create and edit.
- DCA / Combo bots: paying subscribers get the full multi-pair limit again. In multi-pair mode the pair selector was capping paid users at the free-tier maximum (50) instead of the paid maximum (500), because the plan lookup fell back to a free-tier default when only the free/paid flag (not a plan name) was available.

## [2.30.30] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed

- Combo & Grid bots: a grid/minigrid order's price line no longer lingers on the performance chart after that order fills. When an order executed, its filled copy was cached but the stale pending copy was left behind, so the chart's pending-orders filter kept drawing the line (e.g. a combo minigrid sell line staying after the sell). The line now disappears as soon as the order fills.

## [2.30.29] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed

- DCA bots: the Minimum take profit filter (shown for Indicator/Webhook close conditions) can again be edited when editing an existing bot. Its toggle and percentage field were incorrectly locked — and the whole row hidden when the filter was off — on existing bots; they now behave the same as when creating a bot.

## [2.30.28] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed

- Hedge Combo & Hedge DCA bots: corrected the combined Take Profit / Stop Loss tooltips. The combined TP/SL is a portfolio-level close on the hedge's combined PnL that runs *in addition to* each leg's own TP/SL (whichever triggers first closes); it does not replace the per-leg TP/SL as the previous wording implied. Also clarifies that the combined Stop Loss takes a negative percentage.

## [2.30.27] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed

- Hedge Combo & Hedge DCA bots: the combined Stop Loss now accepts a negative percentage (a loss threshold on the hedge's combined PnL), matching the engine and the DCA/combo/grid convention. It previously required a value greater than 0, so a normal stop such as `-25%` could not be saved — and any positive value the form did accept was already satisfied the moment a deal opened, closing the position instantly.

## [2.30.26] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed

- Cloning a hedge combo bot no longer inherits the source bot's state. Previously, cloning a bot that had open deals wrongly reported the clone as having "active deals" and locked leverage, margin and other settings, and the base-order balance stayed at $0 (with "value exceeds the available balance") when a different exchange was picked — the "Update balance" button couldn't fix it. A clone is now treated as a brand-new bot: deal-based locks only apply when actually editing a live bot, and the base-order balance follows the exchange you select in the form.

## [2.30.25] - 2026-07-10

### Fixed

- Bot-creation charts on USD/USDC-quoted exchanges (Kraken futures, Hyperliquid) now render historical candles immediately instead of staying blank when the trading-pairs list is slow to load. The bot form seeds an exchange-appropriate default pair up front (BTC/USD for Kraken futures, BTC/USDC for Hyperliquid) rather than the generic BTC/USDT, which those exchanges don't list, so the chart no longer requests an unsupported pair while pairs load.

## [2.30.24] - 2026-07-10

### Fixed

- Hedge bots (Quick mode): the Investment field now shows a cleanly rounded amount instead of a long floating-point tail (e.g. `600.07828125`).
- Hedge Combo bots (Quick mode): the Investment field is editable again — it previously read the DCA leg's value while writes went to the combo leg, so it appeared frozen.

## [2.30.23] - 2026-07-10

### Fixed

- Kraken and Hyperliquid futures charts now receive live candle updates again — the exchange-native product id (`code`/`wsCode`) is threaded from the resolved symbol to the realtime streamer, which previously logged "product id missing" and never subscribed.

## [2.30.22] - 2026-07-10

### Fixed

- Hedge Combo bots in Quick mode now draw both legs' full grid + DCA ladder on the chart instead of only the DCA safety orders, so the combined view matches the single-leg Manual view.

## [2.30.21] - 2026-07-10

### Fixed

- Switching to another exchange or trading pair no longer freezes the price chart while the previous one is still loading candles — the in-flight request is cancelled immediately instead of blocking the chart until it times out (notably slow endpoints such as Hyperliquid).

### Changed

- During a scheduled maintenance window, tabs running an older build now pick up the new version sooner (still only while you're idle, never mid-interaction), so the maintenance notice and post-deploy code load in time.

## [2.30.20] - 2026-07-10

### Fixed

- Base Order Size now recalculates when you switch its denomination (e.g. quote/USD ↔ base token). Previously the raw number was kept and only re-labelled, so a $10 order became "10 tokens" (~10× price in notional). Affects the DCA, Combo, and Hedge bot forms, which share the base-order control.

## [2.30.19] - 2026-07-10

### Fixed

- Notional Value on leveraged futures deals now shows Cost × leverage instead of collapsing onto the Cost figure. Affected the open-orders table, deal cards, and the Trading page for every futures bot type (DCA, Combo, and Hedge Combo).

## [2.30.18] - 2026-07-10

### Changed

- App updates now apply automatically at the next idle moment — when you switch away from the tab or pause interacting — instead of only when you click the "update available" prompt. Long-lived tabs pick up new releases on their own, and the reload never interrupts an in-progress form or bot setup.

### Fixed

- Price chart now loads on the Hedge Combo create screen for OKX and Coinbase pairs (previously stuck on "Loading chart…" until the bot was saved and reopened).
- Exchange dropdown now scrolls when you have many accounts, instead of overflowing past the screen.

## [2.30.17] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- Hedge Quick chart now draws BOTH legs' base, safety (DCA), and take-profit orders together, instead of flickering between the long or short leg's orders.
- Hedge bot form now has a header validation-alerts button, and Quick mode shows an order-minimum "Min to run" hint plus per-leg below-minimum warnings.
- Hedge footer shows a "Backtest complete · View results" summary chip after a run.

### Fixed

- Hedge Quick risk profiles (Conservative / Balanced / Aggressive) now actually reconfigure both legs when selected — previously only the card highlight changed.
- Selecting a hedge risk profile no longer resets the form's scroll position.
- Hedge Quick now auto-selects the Balanced profile for a new bot.
- Saving a hedge bot now validates each leg's required fields and the shared take-profit / stop-loss, routing to the offending leg and field instead of a raw error toast.
- The hedge bot lists now honor Privacy Mode and disable the "New" button in demo / read-only sessions.
- The risk-profile cards wrap responsively instead of clipping their labels on narrow panels.

### Changed

- Hedge form loading now shows shaped skeletons, and the Quick / Manual toggle collapses to icons when the panel is narrow.

## [2.30.16] - 2026-07-09

### Fixed

- Terminal deals no longer show an "open bot" link. Terminal deals live in the terminal and have no bot page, so the external-link buttons on their cards and rows (and the edit-in-bot navigation) have been removed for them.

## [2.30.15] - 2026-07-09

### Changed

- Internal: the bot-form example-orders and indicator side-effect stores are now instance-scoped via `BotFormProvider` (opt-in `isolateStores`), instead of being shared module globals. Regular DCA, grid, combo, and hedge bots keep using the shared instance and behave identically; this is groundwork so two hedge legs can eventually co-mount one workbench without their order-estimation and indicator pipelines clobbering each other. Risk:Reward stores are intentionally out of scope.

## [2.30.14] - 2026-07-09

### Changed

- Bot edit pages (`/bot/edit`, `/combo/edit`, `/grid/edit`, `/hedge/bot/edit`, `/hedge/combo/edit`) now open ready to edit instead of starting locked behind a "Press Edit" step — reaching an edit page from the sidebar, a bot card, or the drawer always expresses intent to edit. The drawer view routes (`/…/view/:id`) remain the read-only surface, and the footer EDIT/CANCEL toggle still locks the form on demand.
- Unified the DCA, grid, combo, and hedge bot **new & edit** pages onto a shared workbench, page-descriptor, and route table. Cross-cutting concerns — the paper/live mode guard, premium gate, not-found handling, store resets, and the backtests panel — are now declared once per bot type instead of copy-pasted per page, so a bot type can no longer silently miss one. No change to which page renders at any path or to how bots behave.
- Demo / shared-link viewers are now redirected off **every** bot edit page back to the list (previously only grid bots did this; the other types left them on a form that looked editable but couldn't be saved).

### Removed

- Deleted the unused legacy bot detail pages (`TradingBotDetails`, `ComboBotDetails`, `GridBotDetails`) and the unreferenced `pages/bots` barrel; these were superseded by the drawer view routes and were no longer reachable.

## [2.30.13] - 2026-07-09

### Fixed

- Bot create/edit forms (`/bot/new`, `/combo/new`, `/grid/edit`, …): the form footer's action buttons no longer re-render on every live-price tick. `useDcaTradingContext` returned a brand-new object each render, which cascaded into the footer's button-config array and re-rendered the button row ~26×/second — the largest source of render-loop tripwire reports. The trading context is now referentially stable, which also benefits every other consumer of that hook.
- Bot detail drawer (`/bot/view`, `/combo/view`, `/hedge/combo/view`): the footer Start/Stop/Restart/Edit buttons no longer rebuild on every live bot-stats/deal update — the button list and its handlers are now memoized, so the drawer stays idle while the bot streams data.
- Deal edit drawer: the Save/Reset action buttons no longer rebuild every render (the callbacks depended on the whole react-query mutation object instead of its stable `mutate` function).



### Fixed

- Data tables (e.g. the Trading page's bot/trade toolbar): the toolbar button row no longer re-renders on every live price/stats update. The table-preferences state was being rebuilt on every render (fresh default column-visibility/pinned-column objects fed in from the props normalizer), which churned the toolbar's button configs and re-rendered the responsive button row ~26×/second under live data — wasteful work that could push slower devices toward an out-of-memory crash. Default column-visibility and pinned-column inputs are now stable, the bulk-action list depends on a stable handler, and the column dropdown reads a stable table reference, so the toolbar stays idle while data streams.



### Fixed

- Hedge bots: opening or refreshing a hedge bot's edit or detail page while the global Live/Paper toggle is set to the other mode no longer shows a blank form with the exchange undetected. The page now realigns the toggle to the bot's real mode (as the other bot types already did), or shows a clear "Bot not found" notice if the bot exists in neither mode.

## [2.30.10] - 2026-07-09

### Fixed

- Keyboard shortcuts: a malformed or legacy saved shortcut (missing its key binding) no longer crashes the whole dashboard with a blank screen on every page. Such entries now fall back to their default key or are skipped.

## [2.30.9] - 2026-07-09

### Fixed

- Bot DCA Analysis: "Max Configured DCAs" now reflects the bot's real configured DCA orders for indicator- and custom-condition bots (the indicator DCA count / custom DCA table length) instead of the stale `ordersCount` field, which could show a much larger number (e.g. 32) than the bot actually uses. DCA coverage percentages use the same corrected count.

## [2.30.8] - 2026-07-08

### Added

- Backtest settings: custom period start/end now include a time-of-day (date + time), matching the legacy dashboard, instead of dates only.

### Fixed

- Backtest settings: saved periods can now be edited and deleted via a "Manage periods…" option in the period dropdown (the manager dialog was previously unreachable).

## [2.30.7] - 2026-07-08

### Removed

- New-bot page: removed the "Please help us improve this page!" DCA survey prompt pill and its dialog.

## [2.30.6] - 2026-07-08

### Added

- Bot detail sidebar: a bottom action bar with Stop/Start, Restart, and a full-width primary Edit button, shown for every bot type.

### Changed

- Bot detail sidebar: Start/Stop, Restart, and Edit moved out of the header ⋮ menu into the new footer action bar, so they are no longer duplicated. The ⋮ menu keeps Star, Clone, Share Configuration, Duplicate, Archive, and Delete.

## [2.30.5] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed

- Grid bot settings: "Grid step" and "Sell displacement" now display as a percentage (e.g. `1%`) instead of the raw decimal (`0.01`) when reading a bot's configuration — both in the read-only settings drawer and the edit form.
- Grid bot stop loss no longer rejects the negative percentage its own quick-buttons and default fill in. Grid stop loss is a negative drawdown, so a negative value is now accepted (an empty or zero value still prompts you to configure it).
- Grid bot stop-loss and take-profit "action" no longer offers an option that failed to save. "Close position" is now shown as the futures label on the existing "cancel orders and sell base" action rather than a separate option that the backend rejected.

## [2.30.4] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed

- Bot and trade sidebars no longer fetch unused backtest data when they open. The side chart panel never rendered backtest markers, so the request was pure overhead on every sidebar open (across grid, DCA, combo, and hedge bots).

## [2.30.3] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed

- Responsive toolbars (bot/combo deals tables, trades, form footers) no longer trigger a render loop that could freeze the page or crash it with "This page is having a problem / Out of Memory". Rebuilt `ResponsiveButtonRow` so button compaction/overflow recomputes only on a real container-size or button-set change, never on every parent re-render — a parent that recreates its button array on live-data ticks no longer drives the layout math or the parent layout-metrics callback.

## [2.30.2] - 2026-07-07

### Changed

- Wrap ResponsiveButtonRow and BotFormFooter in React.memo. Extract button props in TradeSetupPanel

## [2.30.1] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed

- Portfolio Balances now shows the logo and company name for tokenized-stock holdings (Kraken xStocks, Bybit spot xstocks, Hyperliquid spot RWA) instead of a blank first-letter tile. The row's asset class + venue + human-readable name are resolved from the loaded trading pairs and passed to the coin icon. `normalizeStockTicker` also strips Kraken's tokenized-ledger `.T` suffix (`PGx.T` → `PG`), and a new `balanceAssetToPairBase` maps a ledger code to its tradeable pair base. Paired with the main-app snapshot fix, these holdings also show a real USD value instead of $0.00.

## [2.30.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- Deal action menus now offer "Change DCA levels" for DCA and Combo bot deals (across the trades card view, trades table, and bot deals table), letting you raise or lower a running deal's max DCA safety orders — disabled for risk-based and non-open deals.

### Fixed

- "Move to Terminal" now appears on Combo and Grid bot deals as well as DCA (trades card view, trades table, bot deals table, and their bulk actions), matching the legacy dashboard; combo deals correctly pass the combo flag when moved.

## [2.29.3] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed

- A deal sitting exactly at breakeven (unrealized P&L of $0.00) showed "Price unavailable" instead of "$0.00". The deals-table transform treated a legitimate zero as a missing value. Most visible on Kraken tokenized stocks while the market is closed and the live price is frozen at the average entry price.


## [2.29.2] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed

- Kraken deals showed "Price unavailable" for unrealized P&L: the price fetcher's `essential` exchange list omitted Kraken (and the dynamic active-exchanges effect is disabled), so the dashboard never fetched Kraken prices. Added Kraken (spot + USD-M) to the fetch list.


## [2.29.1] - 2026-07-06

### Fixed

- Tokenized-stock (xStock) chart now shows data: stop uppercasing the pair on the chart path (`AAPLx`→`AAPLX` corrupted the case-sensitive Kraken candle symbol → no bars). xStock pairs are now preserved like `:`-prefixed HIP-3 pairs.
- Stock/ETF icons now render on EVERY surface (bot sidebar, tables, cards): `CoinPair` resolves the base asset's class/venue/name itself from the loaded pairs, so a call site no longer has to pass `assetClass`/`exchange` to get the right logo.


## [2.29.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- Human-readable asset names alongside tickers. The pair picker now shows the base asset's name under the ticker (e.g. "Apple Inc. · USD", "Bitcoin · USDT"), and bot/deal cards reveal it on hover — for all exchanges and asset classes (crypto + tokenized stocks/ETFs). Names come from the new `baseAsset.displayName` field on pairs (`getAllPairs`); the UI falls back to the ticker when a name isn't resolved yet.

## [2.28.3] - 2026-07-06

### Fixed

- Tokenized-stock (xStocks) icons: `normalizeStockTicker` now strips the `x`/`X` wrapper from dotted tickers (`BRK.Bx` → `BRK.B`) so the stock logo resolves instead of a letter monogram. Kept in lock-step with the main-app backend copy.


## [2.28.2] - 2026-07-06

### Fixed

- Add Custom Nav Item dialog: de-duplicate the icon picker so each Lucide icon appears only once (previously `Menu` and `Cloud` showed twice). The list is now deduplicated at render, so accidental repeats can't resurface.

## [2.28.1] - 2026-07-06

### Fixed

- Recent-items page tracking: narrow `MainLayout`'s subscription to the user-sessions store so the app chrome no longer re-renders on unrelated store writes. This removes the amplifier behind a rare navigation crash (React #185) on bot detail pages reached via a redirect.

### Changed

- Crash instrumentation: add an invocation-storm tripwire around page-visit tracking that files a single non-fatal diagnostic (with the recent navigation trail) if start/end-page-visit ever re-enters abnormally fast, and tune the render-loop tripwire to require a sustained burst across consecutive windows so a normal mount/hydration spike no longer reports. Both honor the existing `gainium:tripwire` kill switch.

## [2.28.0] - 2026-07-04

### Added

- Pair picker: "Canonical only" toggle (on by default) with a risk tooltip. Hides permissionless listings (Hyperliquid HIP-1 spot tokens that can impersonate real tickers or carry liquidity/rug risk) while keeping HL-native and Unit-bridged assets; toggle off to show and trade them. Only appears when the list contains non-canonical pairs, and never blocks selection. Applies to every pair-picking surface (DCA, Grid, Combo, Terminal).

## [2.27.2] - 2026-07-04

### Fixed

- Portfolio balances: price balance tokens whose exchange-normalized ticker differs from the snapshot asset name (e.g. Hyperliquid Unit aliases `UBTC`→`BTC`, `USDT0`→`USDT`). These previously rendered at `$0.00` in the enhanced balances table because the price map was keyed only by snapshot names; balance tokens are now also priced from the screener. USDC was unaffected (same name everywhere).

## [2.27.1] - 2026-07-04

### Fixed

- OKX Europe pair scoping: add the `source` field to the `useTradingPairs` `TradingPair` type so the bot-form pair filter type-checks under the production build (`tsc -b`); 2.27.0 built only under the looser dev typecheck.

## [2.27.0] - 2026-07-04

### Added

- OKX Europe support: adding an OKX account with the **my.okx.com** origin now shows a notice that EU accounts trade a restricted product set (USDC/EUR spot; USDT unavailable), and the bot-form pair selector scopes to that account's real universe — EU accounts see only their USDC/EUR pairs, other OKX accounts keep the global list.

## [2.26.4] - 2026-07-03

### Fixed

- Deal chart: the trade overlay now dedupes markers to one per price level per bar and merges any that would overlap on screen at the current zoom, so high-frequency (tight-grid) deals stay responsive without dropping any traded level. Builds on the visible-range filtering from 2.26.3.
- Reduced needless re-renders of the demo-mode prompt pill on every live update.

## [2.26.3] - 2026-07-03

### Fixed

- Deal chart: the trade overlay now draws only the transactions in the visible time range and re-filters as you pan/zoom, instead of drawing every trade at once. High-frequency deals with thousands of trades previously froze the chart and made panning progressively unresponsive; plotting is now bounded and scales with the visible window rather than the deal size.

## [2.26.2] - 2026-07-03

### Changed

- Bot actions menu: the Archive action is now disabled for running bots (open/range/monitoring/error) with a "Stop the bot first" tooltip, matching the backend rule that only stopped bots can be archived. Prevents the misleading "archived successfully" that used to hide a running bot locally until the next full reload. Applies to all bot types (DCA/Grid/Combo/Hedge Combo/Hedge DCA).

## [2.26.1] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed

- `getMaintenanceWarning` now requests `duration` so the maintenance message's `%duration%` placeholder resolves (requires the matching `main-app` schema field).

## [2.26.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- New `layout.maintenanceBanner` extension slot in `MainLayout` for a cloud-only scheduled-maintenance warning banner. Self-hosted builds render nothing.

### Fixed

- `getMaintenanceWarning` query requested a non-existent `textf` field; corrected to `text` so the maintenance message resolves.

## [2.25.8] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed

- Bot drawer performance tab: the equity, realized-profit and buy-and-hold series no longer animate on mount, matching every other chart in the app. This closes a class of crashes ("Something went wrong" / Maximum update depth exceeded) where a chart unmounting mid-animation would trip an internal render loop.
- All remaining charts now disable enter animation consistently, and a lint rule enforces that every new chart series makes this choice explicitly, so the crash class can't come back through a missed chart.

## [2.25.7] - 2026-07-02

### Changed

- Crash reports (the automatic error reporter behind the "Something went wrong" screen) now carry the deployed bundle hash, build mode, React error digest, and a short trail of the last route changes, clicks, resizes and live-update events leading up to a crash, so hard-to-reproduce production crashes can be pinpointed without asking the user to reproduce them. No payload or text content is captured.
- Added an internal render-loop tripwire on the responsive button toolbar: if a component starts re-rendering pathologically fast (the pattern behind "Maximum update depth exceeded"), it reports which props were changing before the page crashes, instead of after. Can be disabled with `localStorage['gainium:tripwire']='off'`.

## [2.25.6] - 2026-07-02

### Changed

- Leverage control (trading terminal and DCA/grid bot forms): redesigned into a single full-width row — the amount input, slider and current value sit together, with one compact row of quick-select presets below — instead of a cramped two-column layout. The slider track is now visible on filled surfaces, the preset buttons were trimmed to the common values (capped at the exchange max), and the bot-form container now uses a filled background to match the terminal.

## [2.25.5] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed

- Coin icons: map Binance's precious-metal commodity tickers (`XAU`/`XAG`/`XPT`/`XPD`) and Brent (`BZ`) onto the shipped metal/oil glyphs instead of the generic commodity badge, so stock/commodity perps show a proper icon.

## [2.25.4] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed

- Stopping a **grid bot** now asks how to handle the orders/position before stopping — cancel all orders, cancel and close the position by LIMIT or MARKET, or cancel except partially filled — matching the legacy dashboard. Previously grid bots stopped silently and left positions/orders open on the exchange. Applies to the bot list, the bot card, the details drawer, and bulk stop.

## [2.25.3] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed

- Grid **Start/Update bot** confirmation dialog: free balances and required amounts are now grouped into per-asset cards with aligned label/value rows, so "what you have" vs "what's needed" reads clearly instead of stacked prose.
- Self-hosted **Admin** page no longer shifts horizontally when switching between tabs — the main content scroll area now reserves a stable scrollbar gutter, so tall tabs (Services, Updates) and short tabs (Diagnostics, Exchanges) stay aligned.
- Opening or refreshing a **paper bot's** detail/edit page (grid, combo, DCA) no longer flips it to Live and shows "Unknown exchange" when your account default is Live — the page now stays in the bot's own paper/live mode.
- Opening a bot that doesn't exist in your paper **or** live account now shows a clear "Bot not found" message with a way back to the list, instead of a broken form with "Unknown exchange".

## [2.25.2] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed

- Starting, stopping, restarting, or deleting a bot no longer spins indefinitely when the bot worker is down, restarting, or backed up: the command now times out after 60s with a clear error toast and the button resets, instead of leaving the bot in limbo behind an endless spinner.

## [2.25.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- Admin → Diagnostics now shows the **price feed connectors** and their role, and warns when no connector is producing the ticker feed that paper/live order-filling needs — with a callout for ticker-only exchanges (e.g. Coinbase). Makes "enabled but no ticks" self-explanatory. Requires admin-sh ≥ 1.3.0; degrades cleanly on older backends.

## [2.24.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- Global warning banner when Binance temporarily restricts a futures account or symbol to reduce-only (Quantitative Rules cooldown): shows the affected account, restricted symbols with level and expiry, that new orders are delayed (not lost) and resume automatically, and that closing positions still works. Dismissable per cooldown window; only shown when a Binance account is connected.

## [2.23.0] - 2026-07-02

### Changed

- Admin → Updates: upgrading **admin-sh** now shows its real outcome. Because the admin service restarts itself, the page waits for it to come back and then confirms the new version instead of reporting "success" immediately. If the self-upgrade can't complete (e.g. `COMPOSE_DIR_HOST_PATH` not set), it now shows a clear error with a copy-paste manual command (`docker compose pull admin-sh && docker compose up -d --force-recreate admin-sh`). "Upgrade all" also upgrades admin-sh last so it can't cut off the other upgrades. Requires admin-sh ≥ 1.2.0.

## [2.22.3] - 2026-07-01

### Fixed

- Dashboard Overview: **normal deal count** and **unrealized P&L** (uPnL) no longer double-count. Grid bots have no DCA-style deals, but the widgets were still requesting DCA deal stats for the grid bot type — which the backend answers with the *DCA* dataset — and summing it on top of the real DCA numbers. Grid is now excluded from the deal-status/uPnL aggregation (matching the legacy dashboard), so the "normal", "in profit", and uPnL figures are correct again.

## [2.22.2] - 2026-07-01

### Fixed

- Asset-class picker: pairs now use their **own per-exchange** class, so a base that is a stock on one venue but crypto on another (e.g. `CAT`, `AAPL` on Hyperliquid) no longer shows under **Stocks** on the wrong exchange.

### Added

- Multi-asset icons for commodities (Au/Ag/Pt/Pd/Cu/Al, oil, gas, corn) and indices (S&P/N225/K200/…); forex reuses the fiat badges. Hyperliquid HIP-3 `dex:` prefixes are stripped for logo/badge lookup, and crypto-native metals (PAXG/XAUT) fall back to their coin logo. Non-crypto class icons are now shipped in `core` (self-hosted) as well as cloud.

## [2.22.1] - 2026-07-01

### Changed

- Quick mode (DCA, Combo, Grid) now shows the **Bot Name** field and auto-fills a meaningful default of `{pair} {strategy or bot type} {date}` (e.g. `BTCUSDT Mid-term 2026-07-01`) instead of the bare `New Bot`. Multi-pair DCA bots use a `{pair} +{n} …` prefix (e.g. `BTCUSDT +4 Mid-term 2026-07-01`). The name stays editable and is left untouched once you type your own.

## [2.22.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- Admin → **Diagnostics** tab (self-hosted): a live health snapshot showing per-exchange market-data feed liveness, Redis reachability, and service up/health state. Flags enabled exchanges that are receiving no live price data — the usual reason simulated or live orders silently stop filling.

## [2.21.4] - 2026-06-30

### Fixed

- Tokenized-stock pairs now show their real company logo (instead of a first-letter tile) on the bot cards, bot list rows and bot detail header — DCA, Grid and Hedge. The read-only views now resolve each pair's asset class + exchange from the loaded trading pairs, matching the bot edit page and pickers.

## [2.21.3] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- DCA & Combo Quick Setup show the minimum investment needed to run ("Min to run"), and the investment slider now floors at that minimum so it can't select a sub-minimum amount.
- Grid Quick Setup shows the minimum budget to run and floors the investment slider at it.

### Fixed

- Grid Manual mode restores the "Min budget is …" hint under the Investment field (ported from the legacy dashboard's budget-range calculation).

## [2.21.2] - 2026-06-30

### Fixed

- Tokenized-stock pairs now show their real company logo in the read-only (locked) Trading Pairs view on the bot edit page — DCA, Combo and Grid — instead of a generic letter tile. Previously the logo only appeared after clicking Edit; the locked view now resolves each pair's asset class + exchange the same way the edit picker does.

## [2.21.1] - 2026-06-30

### Fixed
- Tokenized-stock icons now show the real company logo for Bitget reality (`RAAPL`), Bybit-spot and Kraken xStock (`AAPLX`) pairs — including their paper twins — instead of a generic letter tile. `CoinIcon` venue-gates the ticker normalization and the pair's exchange is threaded through the pair pickers (`CoinPair`, `CoinSelect`, `ListModal`, `PairSelector`); clean tickers like `NFLX` are unaffected.

## [2.21.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- Asset-class filter in the coin/pair pickers (terminal + bot form): browse by Crypto / Stocks / Metals / Commodities (etc.) across exchanges. Only classes actually present render as chips; the market-data sort (crypto-only) hides for non-crypto classes.
- Multi-asset icons: stock/ETF logos load from our backend's self-hosted cache; crypto unchanged (CoinGecko). `CoinIcon`/`CoinPair` resolve icons by asset class, so stocks no longer show false-positive crypto icons.

## [2.20.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- Backtest history: a "Save Permanently" checkbox on every bot type's backtest table (DCA, Combo, Grid, and Hedge — both new and edit pages) lets you mark a backtest so it is not auto-deleted by the cleanup job. Previously this column was a read-only yes/no indicator. Toggling it updates immediately without reloading the table.

## [2.19.2] - 2026-06-30

### Added

- Bot create/edit and the bot details drawer: click a trading pair to load it on the chart. On the bot form (new, edit, and the quick/manual sidebar) clicking a selected pair chip switches the chart to that pair; in the bot details drawer clicking a pair in the Basic section (including the "+N more" list) does the same.

## [2.19.1] - 2026-06-30

### Fixed

- Trades page: fixed a crash ("unexpected error") that made the page fail to load whenever you had open trades and the table layout was selected. The trades table now renders correctly in both table and card views.
- Editing an exchange account: the Update button no longer silently fails to save, the exchange and passphrase fields now populate correctly when opening an existing account (including Bitget), and leaving the API secret or passphrase blank keeps the stored credentials instead of wiping them.

## [2.19.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- Move a terminal deal back into a bot. Open terminal deals now have a "Move to Bot" action (in the trades card menu and the terminal Open Orders table) that adopts the position into an existing DCA bot you choose. Only compatible bots are offered — same exchange, account, direction (long/short), and trading pair — and the now-empty terminal entry is removed afterward. The position is adopted bare and then follows the target bot's take-profit, stop-loss and safety-order settings.

## [2.18.12] - 2026-06-29

### Fixed

- Trading terminal "Import" deal type: the Purchased Price field no longer rejects an entry price above (long) or below (short) the current price. An import declares an already-held position at its historical entry, which can legitimately sit on either side of the current market price. Previously the limit-order direction rule wrongly blocked the price, leaving the deal to import at the wrong (current) price or fall through to a real buy order.
- Trading terminal: placing an order or importing a deal now runs a client-side balance check before submitting (legacy parity). When the account can't fund the order the submit is blocked with "Not enough assets to place order", instead of returning a premature success and then failing asynchronously in the engine ("Not enough balance to start new deal"). Imports of an existing futures position are exempt — they adopt the held position and require no free margin.

## [2.18.11] - 2026-06-29

### Fixed

- Take profit is no longer capped across all bot types (DCA, grid, combo, and hedge variants). High-leverage users can now set an arbitrarily large take profit target (e.g. 5000% on 100x), matching the legacy dashboard. The slider still tops out at 250% for practical use, but the typed value and stored target are uncapped. Previously combo/hedge TP capped at 250% and DCA TP at 100%.
- DCA multi-target take profit: the individual price-distance targets are no longer wrongly forced to sum to ≤100%. Each target is an independent price level (position allocation across targets still sums to 100% as before).
- Combo TP slider drag no longer silently clamps to 50%.

## [2.18.10] - 2026-06-29

### Fixed

- Profit dashboard widget no longer crashes the whole dashboard when the profit data contains a daily row with an unparseable date. Such rows are now skipped instead of throwing "Invalid time value".

## [2.18.9] - 2026-06-28

### Fixed

- Hedge bot Deals tab now refreshes immediately after merging deals. The merge action didn't invalidate the hedge deals query, so the drawer kept showing the stale pre-merge list (old child deals, no merged deal) until a manual page refresh.

## [2.18.8] - 2026-06-28

### Fixed

- Hedge combo/DCA bot details drawer: short-leg deals now show their orders. The drawer only fetched orders for the primary (long) leg, so a short-side deal's order timeline rendered empty ("No orders found") even though the orders existed on the exchange. It now fetches and merges both legs' orders, filtered per deal.

### Changed

- Deal details Orders section: now defaults to a sortable, paginated **table** view (with search and CSV/JSON export) and splits orders into **Pending** and **Completed** tabs. The previous card layout is preserved and available via the Table/Cards toggle.

## [2.18.7] - 2026-06-27

### Fixed

- Hedge bot details drawer: the read-only Settings → Hedge tab now shows the hedge-level Take Profit / Stop Loss from the bot's shared settings instead of always reading "Off". Previously it read these off a leg (which never carries them), so a configured hedge take-profit displayed as "Off" even though editing the bot showed the correct value.

## [2.18.6] - 2026-06-26

### Changed

- Hedge DCA and Combo bot tables: dropped an unused `unPnlMap` dependency from the column-definition memo so the table structure isn't rebuilt on every price tick. No visible change (the unrealized values are already baked into each row).

## [2.18.5] - 2026-06-26

### Changed

- Trading terminal: a futures account can now be selected for a **Simple** order instead of being disabled. Because a Simple order is a one-off market order with no position tracking, picking a futures account now shows a warning that it opens an unmanaged position (no automatic take-profit, stop-loss, or DCA) and to use Smart if you want Gainium to manage it.

### Fixed

- Hyperliquid spot BTC balances now show up in the trading terminal and bot creators. The BTC spot market trades as the `BTC-USDC` pair but Hyperliquid holds the position as `UBTC` (Unit BTC), so the per-asset balance never matched the pair and the terminal showed `0` available to sell — users couldn't sell their spot BTC. Wallet symbols are now canonicalized (`UBTC`/`SBTC` → `BTC`, `SUSD`/`SUSDT` → `USD`/`USDT`) when reconciling balances against the selected pair.

## [2.18.4] - 2026-06-26

### Fixed

- Hedge bots no longer show `$0.00` unrealized P&L and an empty deals drawer for some bots when an account has more than 500 open hedge deals. The hedge deal fetch stopped at the backend's 500-row page limit, so bots whose deals fell outside the most-recent 500 were dropped from the unrealized calculation (cards, list table, drawer) and the drawer's deals tab. It now pages through the full deal set.

## [2.18.3] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- Values derived from live market prices (Unrealized P&L, Net P&L, Current Value, and the sidebar uPnL/Total PnL totals) now show a loading skeleton while prices are still being fetched, instead of briefly displaying a misleading `0`. Applies to the deals and open-orders tables, the bot performance drawer, the DCA/Combo/Grid bot list tables, and the trading-bot sidebar panels.

## [2.18.2] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- DCA, Combo and Hedge bots can again set max open deals up to 200. The save-time field mapper was silently capping the value at 50 (rejecting anything higher with "Max open deals must be between 1 and 50"), even though the form validation and the previous dashboard both allowed up to 200. The mapper now matches at 200.

## [2.18.1] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- Kraken backtests work again on both spot and futures. Bot backtests (and the curated-preset return estimates) on Kraken pairs were silently returning no candle data and 0 deals because the candle request used the concatenated pair form (`BTCUSDT`) that Kraken's market-data API rejects. Candle requests now use Kraken's dashed native pair (`BTC-USDT` for spot, `BTC-USD` for USDⓈ-M futures), matching the existing KuCoin-spot handling.

## [2.18.0] - 2026-06-25

### Added

- Hedge bot details: a unified view that shows **both legs together** instead of a Long/Short switcher. The Overview has a combined stats block plus each leg; Deals lists both legs' deals in one table; Events is one merged feed; the chart is a single panel. Settings keeps a Hedge / Long / Short switch (Hedge shows the shared take-profit / stop-loss).

### Fixed

- Hedge bot combined and per-leg **Unrealized PnL / current value** no longer read $0.00 for bots on exchanges absent from the price feed (e.g. Kraken futures): the values are now taken from the server-computed deal data. Capital "cost" on each leg is likewise sourced from the deals so it no longer flickers.
- Clicking a deal in a hedge bot's Deals tab now opens it **in place** within the same drawer, matching the other bot types, instead of stacking a second drawer on top.
- Grid bots Quick form: the Investment now defaults to a sensible non-zero amount (sized so each grid level clears the exchange minimum, capped at your available balance) instead of 0, which previously tripped a per-level-minimum error on launch.

## [2.17.2] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- Hedge bots Quick form: Investment is now the **total** funds the leg deploys across the base order and every safety order, distributed using the same math as the standalone Quick bot — instead of being set as each individual order size (which over-committed by the order count). Editing the total redistributes it, and risk-profile presets keep the total constant while re-spreading it over the new orders ladder.

## [2.17.1] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- Hedge bots Quick form: a short leg on a USDⓈ-M futures account now shows its Investment in the settlement asset (e.g. USDT) instead of the base coin; the coin icon and unit label always match. COIN-M still shows the base coin, spot shorts the base asset.
- Hedge bots Quick form: the Investment slider now scales to the leg's actual available balance on its exchange, instead of a fixed 0–100 range. Both legs resolve their own balance even when they sit on different exchanges.

## [2.17.0] - 2026-06-25

### Added

- Paper `SPOT & Futures` accounts can now be funded independently per market: the Add Exchange form shows a separate asset + amount for each account it will create (SPOT / USDⓈ-M / COIN-M), with the COIN-M account coin-margined (BTC/ETH). Sent via the new `addExchange` `topUps` field.

### Changed

- Add Exchange paper dropdown de-duplicated: each exchange now lists one clear entry per market (SPOT / SPOT & Futures / Futures) instead of a redundant bare umbrella alongside an explicit variant. Hyperliquid's spot entry is labeled "SPOT"; Paper Bitget gains SPOT and SPOT & Futures entries.
- Paper top-up asset lists corrected per exchange from real tradeable-pair coverage (e.g. Kraken defaults to USD, not USDT; dropped delisted BUSD/TUSD/GUSD/PAX/DAI; Coinbase offers USD).
- A `SPOT & Futures` selection now shows the funding field and defaults the account name to the exchange brand (e.g. "Paper Kraken"), so created accounts read "Paper Kraken (Spot)" instead of "Paper Kraken SPOT & Futures (Spot)".

### Fixed

- "My Accounts" now refreshes immediately after adding a `SPOT & Futures` account (every created sub-account is added to the list, not just the first).

## [2.16.1] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- Hedge bots Quick form: creating a bot no longer fails with "Cannot read properties of undefined" — each leg's pair metadata is now preserved when the create payload is built.
- Hedge bots Quick form: Investment is set per leg in the correct asset — the long leg in quote (e.g. USDT) and the short leg in base (e.g. BTC) — instead of one shared number that landed as the wrong asset on the short leg. Each leg's slider is capped at that leg's available balance.
- Order-size coin icon could briefly show the wrong coin (e.g. a USDT logo labelled BTC) when the unit changed; the icon now always matches its label.

### Changed

- Order-size fields across all bot types now show the unit symbol (e.g. "USDT", "BTC") next to the coin icon.

## [2.16.0] - 2026-06-25

### Added

- Hedge DCA bots page: a "Deals" tab (next to "Bots") lists every open or closed deal across your hedge bots' legs, matching the Deals view already on the regular bots page.

### Fixed

- "Capital Deployed" now reflects the capital actually committed to open positions (the live cost shown in each bot's "Cost" column) instead of the larger reserved-budget figure, so the stat reconciles with the table. Applies to the DCA, Combo, Hedge DCA, and Hedge Combo bot lists and the combined Trading overview.

## [2.15.1] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed

- Hedge combo bot deals: unrealized profit no longer shows a wildly inflated figure for COIN-M (inverse) legs. The deal table now applies the combo profit formula to hedge-combo legs and converts via the quote asset, matching the value the backend reports.
- COIN-M unrealized profit on the dashboard treemap, bot cards, and DCA deal lists no longer shows an inflated figure — the shared calculation now converts via the quote asset for COIN-M positions too.

## [2.15.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- Sidebar edit mode: reorder navigation items by dragging, move them between sections, create and rename your own sections, and add custom links into any section. A "Reset to default" control restores the shipped layout. Open it from the pencil button in the sidebar header.

## [2.14.1] - 2026-06-23

### Fixed

- Bot events panel: events now show clean, consistent labels derived from the event type rather than guessed from message text. Settings changes are no longer mislabelled "Bot Status", buy/sell direction is only shown when the backend actually reports it, and raw internal names (e.g. "Buy dialog") render as readable titles.

## [2.14.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- Funding rate

## [2.13.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added

- Bot Webhooks section now has Incoming/Outgoing tabs. Outgoing webhooks (notify an external URL on bot start/stop and deal open/close) save to the bot immediately on add, edit, or delete and persist across reloads.

### Fixed

- Outgoing webhooks were previously held in local state only — never saved, did not mark the bot as modified, and were lost on reload. They now load from and persist to the backend.
- Usage column on the Trading Bots and Combo Bots tables now sorts and filters by the numeric usage percentage instead of the underlying object, so number filters and ordering work.
- Usage column in the bot drawer's deals table can now be filtered numerically.

## [2.12.4] - 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- Cloning a Combo or Grid bot now opens a pre-filled, unsaved create form where the exchange (and other settings) can still be changed — matching the legacy UI. Previously the clone landed on the saved bot's edit page, where the exchange was locked.

## [2.12.3] - 2026-06-18

### Fixed

- New-bot page: the Quick setup no longer crashes ("split is not a function") and blanks out when the selected trading pair value is malformed (non-string) — the form stays mounted and usable.

## [2.12.2] - 2026-06-18

### Fixed

- Overview: the Profit widget no longer crashes ("Invalid time value") when a profit row has a missing or malformed date — such rows now render with an empty tooltip date instead of taking down the widget.
- Bot tables: fixed an infinite render loop ("Maximum update depth exceeded") in the data table's selected-rows tracking that could spike CPU on pages with selectable tables (e.g. bot edit panels).

## [2.12.1] - 2026-06-17

### Fixed

- OAuth consent: forward the `resource` indicator to the authorization decision so the issued grant is bound to the target MCP resource. Combined with the backend scope clamp, the read-only connector (`mcp.gainium.io/read`) no longer shows or grants a write toggle.

## [2.12.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added

- Login & Security: "Allowed Login Methods" — choose which methods (password, Google, email link, passkey) can sign in to your account. Disabling a method blocks it everywhere; at least one method must stay enabled. (Cloud only.)

### Fixed

- Two-Factor Authentication: the setup flow now shows the scannable QR code (previously only the secret key was shown).
- Two-Factor Authentication: the 2FA toggle now reflects the real enabled state — the user query now fetches `otp.otp_enabled`, so enabling 2FA (in either dashboard) is reflected on refresh/login instead of always appearing off.

## [2.11.1] - 2026-06-17

### Changed

- Affiliate program: hide the Affiliate page and nav entry for users in the EU (the program is not available there), driven by the new `isEuRegion` user flag.

## [2.11.0] - 2026-06-16

### Added

- Hedge bots: Import / Export settings — export both legs plus the shared TP/SL settings to JSON (copy, download, or edit inline) and import them back, with a guard that rejects files from the wrong hedge type.
- Hedge bots: a footer options (⋮) menu, matching regular bots — Reset to defaults, plus full template support (Save as template, Load template, and global template hotkeys).
- Hedge bots: the Hedge (shared settings) tab now shows the same Backtest and Create/Save footer as the Long and Short leg tabs.

## [2.10.30] - 2026-06-15

### Changed

- Disable TradingView's built-in Google Analytics usage telemetry on the chart widget (it sent anonymized pageviews to a TradingView Google Analytics property). Analytics is handled exclusively through PostHog.

## [2.10.29] - 2026-06-15

### Changed

- Mark the app shell `noindex, nofollow`. The dashboard is logged-in and not meant to be indexed; this also clears the search-console "duplicate pages without canonical" warnings caused by PostHog `ph_distinct_id` / `ph_session_id` query params.

## [2.10.28] - 2026-06-16

### Fixed

- Bot performance chart: data points are now sorted by time, so the Equity / Realized Profit / Buy & Hold lines no longer zigzag and "Realized Profit" no longer appears to fall over time (the backend serves the points unsorted).
- Bot performance chart: the "Realized Profit" line and its hover tooltip now show the true realized profit (starting at 0) instead of a value offset by the bot's starting balance, and the right-hand axis it is plotted against is now visible — so the plotted line and the info box value finally agree.

## [2.10.27] - 2026-06-16

### Fixed

- Toast dismiss no longer throws "removeChild: not a child of this node" when a toast is removed while its parent container has already been detached (e.g. on the Combo bots page during rapid drawer open/close).
## [2.10.26] - 2026-06-15

### Fixed

- Hyperliquid "Add Exchange": the "Connect Web3 Wallet" button is shown for
  the Regular (paid) integration type again, not only for Free — paid users
  can set up Hyperliquid via their wallet without entering keys manually.
- A bot's closed deals are reachable again when it has no open deals. The
  Open/Closed filter now stays visible on the empty deals state, so closed
  deals are no longer stranded behind an empty "Open" tab.
- Deals overview "Close Time" column now shows the correct date — day and
  month are no longer swapped (the value was formatted to a locale string
  and then re-parsed ambiguously).
- Deals overview "Bot Name" falls back to the loaded bot's name when the
  deal record doesn't carry one, instead of rendering a bare "—".
- Deals overview "Bot Name" column is wider and shows the full name on
  hover, so longer bot names aren't cut off at ~15 characters.

## [2.10.25] - 2026-06-14

### Fixed

- Bot deals list now drops a deal from the Open list once its take-profit
  fills, instead of leaving a sold deal showing as open until the page is
  reloaded. The drawer re-checks its deals periodically so closed deals are
  reconciled away.
- Open and Closed deal lists now keep their column layout and sort order
  independently — hiding a column (e.g. Unrealized P&L) or changing the sort
  on one list no longer affects the other.
- Cached query data is now kept for 5 minutes instead of 24 hours, matching
  the persisted-cache window so a re-opened view can't briefly show a much
  older snapshot.
- Settings "Connected Apps" tab no longer hard-imports a cloud-only
  component, so the self-hosted build type-checks and builds again. The
  section is now rendered through the `settings.connectedApps` extension
  slot, empty on self-hosted (no OAuth provider).

## [2.10.24] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- Connect guide in the add-exchange dialog now also covers Bitget and Kraken
  (previously only Binance, Bybit, KuCoin, OKX, Coinbase and Hyperliquid).

### Removed

- Combo bot deal menu no longer shows "Add Funds" / "Reduce Funds" — combo
  bots don't support adjusting deal funds.

### Fixed

- Portfolio "My Accounts" list now scrolls, so exchanges past the bottom of
  the panel are reachable again.
- The connect guide is no longer shown for paper exchanges, which need no
  API connection.
- Editing a live exchange (e.g. renaming it) no longer forces re-entering the
  API secret.

## [2.10.23] - 2026-06-11

### Fixed

- DIV indicator logic.

## [2.10.22] - 2026-06-10

### Changed

- Backtester performance fix.

## [2.10.21] - 2026-06-10

### Changed

- Backtest results deal chart now fills its panel directly with rounded
  corners, instead of sitting inside a padded inner card.

### Fixed

- Bot detail side panels now use the base-canvas surface, so deal cards and
  overview widgets stay visually distinct from the panel instead of blending
  into it (regression from the 2.10.20 solid-panel change).
- Backtest results "Deals" list: the open deal now shows its unrealized P&L
  (coloured by sign) instead of a flat 0.00% / $0.00.
- Backtest results "Deals" header: add a little spacing between the "Deals"
  label and the deal count.
- Backtest results "DCA ladder": safety-order deviation now reads cumulatively
  from entry (and rung prices follow), instead of showing each order's step
  from the previous one — every rung past the first was sitting too close to
  entry.

## [2.10.20] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- Bot detail drawer "DCA Analysis" now shows the configured projection
  (deviation covered, average down power, capital needed) alongside the
  deal-level usage stats, and is shown for Combo bots too — not just DCA.

### Fixed

- DCA overview (coverage / average down power / total funds, plus the orders
  table and graph) no longer reads 0 / empty when viewing an existing bot's
  settings; it now projects the saved configuration, matching the create/edit
  form's figures for both DCA and Combo bots.

### Changed

- Bot detail side panels use a solid background instead of a translucent glass
  surface, so the form and content underneath are easier to read.

## [2.10.19] - 2026-06-10

### Added

- Bot tables (DCA, Combo, Grid, Hedge DCA, Hedge Combo) now expose a "BOT ID"
  column, hidden by default and toggleable from the Columns menu.

### Changed

- The deal table's "Deal ID" column is now hidden by default (still
  toggleable from the Columns menu) instead of always shown.
- Replaced the remaining native browser dialogs (confirm/alert/prompt) with
  in-app React dialogs and toasts across Global Variables, bot form reset and
  save-as-template, widget reset, tag editing, Notes link insertion, order
  notes, and API key rename/restrict/delete.

### Fixed

- Combo bot "Total Profit" in the bot table/card now matches the bot
  drawer. The table was showing the asset-blended `profit.total` figure
  under the "$" column instead of the USD value, so list and detail views
  disagreed.
- Global Variables: editing a variable no longer leaves the Type and Value
  fields blank. A stray empty change event from the type dropdown was
  clearing both when the edit dialog opened.

## [2.10.18] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- Closing several deals in a row from the deals card view no longer crashes
  the page (React error #185). The deal-card price sparkline and the bot-card
  equity chart had their mount animation enabled; recharts fires a state
  update from that animation's unmount cleanup, so a batch of cards
  unmounting mid-animation tripped React's nested-update limit.

### Changed

- The Bots/Deals toggle on the DCA and Combo bot pages is now reflected in
  the URL (`?view=deals`), so reloads, deep links, and closing the bot
  drawer land back on the same view. Legacy `?view=<botId>` links on the
  DCA page still redirect to the bot drawer.

## [2.10.17] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- Existing stale deals/bots now actually clear on upgrade. The stale-write
  guards (2.10.15–16) prevented _new_ contamination but couldn't evict
  entities already resurrected into the persisted caches before the fix
  shipped. This release busts both persisted layers on deploy: the live
  Zustand stores (deals + all bot types) wipe and refetch on version bump,
  and the React Query persisted cache is now keyed to the app version so a
  pre-deploy snapshot can no longer replay after an upgrade.
- The combo-deal list reconciliation now works against the production
  backend, which returns the full active set without pagination counts
  (`totalResults`/`totalPages` are null). Pruning was previously gated on a
  numeric `totalResults` and so never ran in production, leaving closed combo
  deals in the list. It now treats a response as complete unless it
  explicitly signals more pages, while still only pruning against a fresh
  snapshot.

## [2.10.16] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- Hardened deal-list reconciliation against stale cached responses: the
  absence-delete that prunes closed deals now runs only against a snapshot
  proven fresh (each query response is stamped with its network fetch time),
  and never removes a deal updated after that snapshot was taken. A replayed
  cache entry — even one that looks complete — can no longer prune live deals
  that arrived after it was cached. Closes the last window in which an open
  deal could briefly vanish on navigating back to a deals list.

## [2.10.15] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- Closed/canceled deals and stopped/deleted bots no longer reappear in lists
  after navigating away and back (or reloading within the cache window). The
  cached list responses replayed into the live stores could resurrect
  entities that were just mutated locally. All store write paths (query
  write-backs, websocket events) now go through freshness arbitration plus
  short-lived tombstones for locally closed deals / deleted bots, and
  close/stop/delete actions immediately patch the cached list responses
  themselves. Covers DCA, Combo, Grid, both Hedge bot types, and the bot and
  deal views.
- Deal lists now reconcile against the server snapshot: a deal the backend no
  longer returns as active is removed from the local store (previously stale
  Combo deals could linger indefinitely), without pruning when the response
  is known to be page-capped.

## [2.10.14] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- Editing and saving a DCA or Combo bot no longer fails with
  `Field "avgPrice" is not defined by type "changeDCABotInput"`. The
  deal-edit-only **Breakeven price** (`avgPrice`) seeded into the form
  defaults was leaking into the bot **update** payload — the same leak that
  2.10.9 fixed for bot **create**. It's now stripped (alongside
  `useExperimental`) before the update mutation. Grid bots and hedge legs are
  unaffected.
- The bot-create "insufficient credits" guard now reads the **bot credits**
  pool (`subscription.credits.balance` minus `locked`) instead of the
  consumable `user.credits` pool. Users who had bot credits but no consumable
  balance were wrongly blocked from creating bots.

## [2.10.13] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- New-bot page no longer gets stuck on "No trading pairs available" (and a
  0 available balance) until a hard refresh. When the trading-pairs cache was
  emptied — by the hourly cleanup or a live/paper context switch — while the
  pairs query result was still cached, the store wasn't being repopulated and
  stayed empty. `useTradingPairs` now re-syncs from the cached result the
  moment the store is marked stale, matching how exchanges already recover.

### Changed

- New-bot wizard: the combo bot card now describes it as blending DCA and grid
  strategies, and the selected bot-type card uses a ring highlight instead of a
  filled background.

## [2.10.12] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- Closed and canceled deals no longer report an unrealized P&L on the
  bot deals table — they show "-" instead of the stale value the server
  keeps after a deal closes, and sorting/totals treat them as neutral.

## [2.10.11] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- Replaced `document.body.removeChild(tmp)` with `tmp.remove()` in `getCSSVar` color-resolution utility to prevent a DOM exception when the temporary measurement element is no longer a direct child of `document.body`.
- Bot error messages now reach the live toast (the WS payload is
  unwrapped like every sibling event handler, and the toast header uses
  the bot name) and the Notifications panel refreshes on every open
  instead of serving a 5-minute stale cache.

## [2.10.10] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- Adding or reducing funds on a deal now reports "Add funds scheduled"
  (the backend's actual response) instead of falsely claiming the funds were
  added — the request is only queued at that point, and the order can still
  be rejected by the exchange.
- That later exchange-side rejection (insufficient balance, min notional,
  ...) is now surfaced in the terminal: live bot error/warning messages are
  shown as toasts as they arrive, instead of being swallowed. Routine
  info-level bot messages stay quiet (kept in the message store for a
  notification panel) to avoid noise.
- A synchronous add/reduce-funds failure (rejected before scheduling) now
  surfaces the backend reason instead of failing silently.

### Added

- Mutations can opt into global error feedback with
  `meta: { errorToast: true }` (toasts the thrown reason) or
  `meta: { errorToast: 'message' }` (fixed text), giving a single place to
  surface failures for fire-and-forget mutations.

## [2.10.9] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- Placing a Trading Terminal order (or creating a DCA/Combo bot) no longer
  fails with `Field "avgPrice" is not defined by type "createDCABotInput"`.
  The deal-edit-only **Breakeven price** (`avgPrice`) added in 2.10.7 was
  leaking from the form defaults into the bot-create payload; it's now
  stripped before the create mutation, alongside `useExperimental`.

## [2.10.8] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- Toolbar action rows no longer crash with "Maximum update depth exceeded"
  after a tab is left open in the background. `ResponsiveButtonRow` now
  rounds its measured button widths to whole pixels, so sub-pixel jitter
  from `getBoundingClientRect` can't defeat the change-detection guard and
  spin the measure→render loop forever. Affects the Overview tables, bot
  form footer, and every other consumer of the shared button row.

## [2.10.7] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- Deal Edit now exposes a **Strategy** section with the manual **Breakeven
  price** (single-deal edit, with a Reset to the live average) and the
  **Profit currency** selector, matching the legacy deal editor.
- The combo Stop Loss view now shows the weighted **Average stop loss**
  readout (already present on regular bots), so it appears for combo deals
  in Deal Edit too.
- Exchange connection form: Bybit and OKX **origin host** options now match
  the legacy dashboard (Bybit eu/com/tr/kz/ge; OKX my/app/com, including the
  new `app` origin), shown as bare origin URLs under an "OKX Origin" /
  "Bybit Origin" label.

### Changed

- Deal Edit tab bar now uses the same rounded floating style as the new bot
  form, and the section order is now Strategy, Take Profit, Stop Loss, DCA
  (DCA moved last).
- Deal Edit no longer shows the "Edit Deal" heading — the tab bar sits at the
  top of the drawer with the close button on the right.
- The bot form and Deal Edit now render section headers from a single shared
  `SectionHeader` component, so the two stay visually identical.

### Fixed

- The Actions column now stays pinned to the right even on tables with
  nested-accessor columns. The default column order and the resize lookup
  now mirror react-table's id resolution (`a.b` → `a_b`); the hedge bot
  tables pin Actions right; and a one-time table-preferences migration (v2)
  drops stale saved column order/pins so the right pin re-applies (widths,
  visibility, sorting, filters, pagination and view mode are kept).

## [2.10.6] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- The Actions column now stays pinned to the right edge of every data table.
  Columns with a nested accessor (e.g. `settings.startCondition`) were
  rendering to the right of Actions because the table built its default column
  order from the raw accessor key, while react-table registers nested keys
  with underscores (`settings_startCondition`) — so those columns looked
  "missing" and got appended past the right pin. The default order (and the
  resize lookup) now mirror react-table's id resolution. Also pinned Actions by
  default on the two hedge bot tables that were missing it, and reset saved
  column order/pins once (keeping widths, visibility, sorting, and filters) so
  existing layouts pick up the fix.

## [2.10.5] - 2026-06-07

### Fixed

- Grid bot edit page no longer crashes with a React "Maximum update depth
  exceeded" error. `BotFormWidget` mounted its own `GridPageProvider` even when
  the grid edit page already wrapped the whole layout in one, giving the page
  two `useGridPage` instances that fired duplicate queries and raced on the
  shared live stores — an infinite render loop. The form now reuses an existing
  provider and only mounts its own when there isn't one (e.g. the grid _new_
  page).
- Hardened several render-stability bugs surfaced while tracking the above:
  the bot-orders store-sync effect no longer depends on the whole (per-render)
  `options` object; `useGridBacktests` no longer returns a freshly-filtered
  array on every render; and the grid edit page's backtest table callbacks now
  depend on stable mutation references instead of the per-render mutation
  objects.

### Changed

- Crash reports now decode minified React error codes (e.g. "#185") into a
  human-readable description before they're logged, so production error
  reports are legible without cross-referencing react.dev.

## [2.10.4] - 2026-06-07

### Fixed

- Combo/short bot cards no longer show absurd unrealized P&L percentages
  (e.g. -4273%). For short positions the ROI is now measured against the
  quote value of the position instead of the realized profit, and the
  "Cost (Invested)" figure is shown in the quote asset.
- Dev only: localhost no longer renders a stale precached bundle. A leftover
  service worker is unregistered (with its caches cleared) at app entry, the
  app never registers a service worker in dev, and a service-worker update
  only forces a reload when it replaces an existing one (not on first visit).

## [2.10.3] - 2026-06-07

### Fixed

- TradingView chart: support an optional injected datafeed so a host app can
  supply its own data source per chart instance, and skip the shared-exchange
  history prefetch and global symbol-state writes when one is supplied;
  removed the manual-backtesting→Binance fallback alias from the shared
  candle path.
- IndexedDB persistence no longer freezes when a cached blob picks up a
  non-cloneable value: `setItem` now strips the offending data and retries,
  so manual-backtesting session deletes/creates (and other persisted-store
  writes) save reliably instead of silently failing on older caches.

## [2.10.2] - 2026-06-07

### Fixed

- Live and paper deals no longer mix, and already-closed deals no longer
  linger, after upgrading. Persisted deal/order/transaction/bot caches are
  now versioned and wiped once on load so each device refetches cleanly
  (the old cache held mis-tagged and stale deals from before the
  paperContext fix).

### Added

- Bot create submit is disabled when the account has insufficient credits.

## [2.10.1] - 2026-06-07

### Fixed

- Combo per-deal chart lines are now capped at each minigrid's close time and kept separate across minigrids that share the same price level. The backtest export now carries `minigridId` (and `type`) on order entries (backtester ≥ 1.6.2); DCA and grid charts are unaffected.

## [2.10.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added

- Grid and Combo bots now open in the redesigned full-screen results modal — on both the create and edit pages, and from the bot Backtests widget (which loads the full local result first) — replacing the old inline backtest result tabs. Grid shows Overview / Transactions / Equity / Stats; Combo shows the DCA tabs (Overview / Stats / Deals / Analysis). The per-deal chart draws orders and fills straight from the deal's order history (`filledOrders` / `ordersHistory`), matching the legacy main-dash deal chart for DCA.
- Grid bots now show a price chart in the backtest results Transactions tab: horizontal lines for each resting grid level plus buy/sell fill markers, with clickable transaction rows that pan the chart to that execution.

### Fixed

- Combo per-deal chart order lines are now robust. Resting orders are no longer deleted when a new minigrid opens (their exchange orders aren't cancelled, so the lines run on), and a buy line no longer continues past where it filled. Lines are reconstructed from the actual price path — `ordersHistory[].filledTime` conflates real fills with minigrid regrids — so each line ends where the price genuinely crosses it.
- DCA per-deal chart now renders the single take-profit as one stepping line (instead of a stack of separate TP lines) and ends each safety-order line at its fill, matching how DCA bots actually work.
- Changing the exchange or symbol on the new bot page no longer freezes the tab. The chart's symbol could ping-pong between the form's exchange (`hyperliquid`) and TradingView's resolved form (`hyperliquidLinear`) indefinitely; the prop-driven update now reacts only to genuine form changes and lets TradingView's resolution settle.

## [2.9.2] - 2026-06-06

### Fixed

- Profit widget on Overview crashes ("xe.split is not a function") when the backend returns a weekly or monthly date value as a number instead of a string; `as string` assertions replaced with `String()` runtime conversions.

## [2.9.1] - 2026-06-05

### Changed

- Backtest results Deals view now renders a real TradingView chart per deal — actual candles with a buy/sell icon for each filled order and the safety-order, averaged-entry, and take-profit levels drawn as time-bounded segments that step with each DCA fill; switching deals pans the chart to the new deal's window.
- Order-line segments on the TradingView chart now stay visible while panning as long as they cross the viewport, instead of vanishing once their start scrolls off-screen.
- The bot form footer's "View results" summary chip is now dismissible (× on the right), restoring the backtest run controls so another backtest can be run.
- The backtest results modal is now mobile-friendly: full-bleed (no margins) on phones, a taller deal chart, a deal list that stacks above the inspector, single-column detail panels, and a header whose close button sits top-right with the tabs wrapping below.

### Added

- Clicking a backtest row on the DCA bot create/edit page now opens the full-screen results modal instead of rendering the results inline in the widget; the same modal also opens from the backtest history table and the bot Backtests widget.

## [2.9.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added

- Redesigned full-screen backtest results modal for DCA bots, with an Overview tab (headline KPIs, win-rate and profit-factor donuts, equity curve, P&L scatter) and a split-inspector Deals view (selectable deal rail with prev/next and arrow-key navigation, per-deal price chart, deal detail, and safety-order ladder); Stats and Analysis reuse the existing tabs.
- "VIEW RESULTS" summary chip in the bot form footer: when a local DCA backtest finishes, the backtest controls morph into a chip showing net %, win rate, and deal count that opens the new results modal.

## [2.8.7] - 2026-06-05

### Added

- Shift-click range selection in data tables
- Strategy column in the bot deals drawer

### Fixed

- Restore the reports params in `getNavigationSections` (they were commented out while call sites still passed them, breaking the build)

## [2.8.6] - 2026-06-04

### Changed

- Capital-required popup: itemize the DCA section into one row per safety order
  (e.g. "DCA 1 (2%) — 100 USDT") with a "Total DCA orders" subtotal, instead of
  a single aggregate row.

### Fixed

- Terminal deal credit cost showed 50 instead of the backend's flat 10; the
  footer now keys the cost off the terminal flag so the chip matches what's
  actually charged.

## [2.8.5] - 2026-06-04

### Changed

- Bot forms always start from default values. Removed the "last used config"
  persistence that restored the previous bot's settings into new forms
  (terminal/DCA/combo/grid/both hedge legs), which surfaced stale values such
  as 5 max open deals in the terminal capital chip. Explicit seeds (curated
  presets, Copy to live, backtest load, clone) still apply via `initialFormData`
  / the `sessionStorage.botConfig` channel.

## [2.8.4] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- KuCoin spot candles: send the dashed native symbol (BTC-USDT) instead of the
  app's concatenated pair (BTCUSDT) at the `requestCandles` chokepoint, fixing
  `400100 Unsupported trading pair` on KuCoin backtests and the quick-panel
  risk/market-stats fetch. Other exchanges and KuCoin futures are unchanged.

## [2.8.3] - 2026-06-04

### Changed

- Trading terminal Simple/Smart/Import brought to legacy parity: Buy/Sell side
  buttons (Import inverts Buy→short / Sell→long); Import shows the full Take
  Profit / Stop Loss / DCA / Risk:Reward sections with a labeled entry-price
  field ("Purchased Price" / "Sold Price"); Simple drops Profit Currency and
  futures; the Quick/Manual toggle is shown only for Smart.
- Trading terminal: restore the legacy dual Amount/Total order-size fields
  (both visible, kept in sync via price; focus implies the unit) in place of the
  single Base Order Size field. Applies to Simple/Smart/Import.
- Bot form: move "what it does" helper text into field tooltips across the
  combo, DCA, and grid sections (Deal close type, Base Take Profit/Stop Loss On,
  grid direction/type/range/budget, Dynamic ATR/ADR). Constraints, ranges, and
  computed values stay inline.
- Combo grid strategy: drop the verbose section copy into a tooltip and fold the
  current grid spacing % into the spacing chip (always shown).

### Fixed

- Trading terminal: always keep a pair selected — default to BTC against
  USDT/USDC/USD (else the first available pair) when an exchange is chosen.
- Trading terminal percentage buttons (10–100%) now set the Amount in base
  units instead of applying the quote total as a base amount.
- Trading terminal: switching focus between the Amount and Total fields converts
  the size into the focused unit instead of reinterpreting the stored number.
- Trading terminal Import: balance/max now reads the correct wallet (base for a
  long holding, quote for a short).
- Trading terminal: the Amount field's USD estimate reflects the shown amount;
  tighten the spacing between the Deals/Exchange tabs and the table.
- Hide "Order Size Reference" in the bot form on spot exchanges — it only
  applies to leveraged/futures positions.
- Asset precision: `math.getPrecisionFromDecimalString` now matches the legacy
  `botUtils.getAssetPrecision` exactly — fixes an off-by-one in the multi-zero
  branch (e.g. `0.0003` now resolves to 4 decimals, not 3) and restores the
  Kucoin/paperKucoin path that keeps trailing zeros after the significant digit.
  Pass the pair's exchange to opt into the Kucoin behaviour.

## [2.8.0] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- Trading Terminal "Exchange Orders" tab: raw open exchange orders & positions
  with per-row Cancel / Import actions (import a position as a terminal deal,
  import an order into a smart terminal bot).

### Fixed

- DCA Bot Controller parity with legacy: newly added start/stop indicators are
  now tagged with their `indicatorAction` and `groupId`, so indicator-mode
  start/stop conditions are no longer silently dropped from the saved payload.
- Bot Controller now reconciles indicators when toggled or switched: enabling
  the controller (or switching Bot Start/Stop to indicators) auto-seeds a
  group + indicator, disabling/leaving indicator mode strips them, and empty
  groups are pruned — matching legacy.
- Integer-coerce `closeAfterX` / `closeAfterXopen` on commit; auto-clamp
  `closeAfterXopen` up to the max open deals and validate it is not lower.
- Narrow the multipair reset to only downgrade price-mode triggers to manual
  (indicator mode and entered price values are left intact).
- Restore legacy Bot Controller labels, `deals` / `$` input adornments,
  between-group AND/OR separators, and the global "add indicator (new group)"
  button.

## [2.7.10] - 2026-06-03

### Fixed

- Dynamic AR config missed in SL panel.
- ADR timeframe bug.

## [2.7.9] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- Pair preset selector: list + detail view with ROI / market-cap / volume / RSI
  sort, favorites, and filters. Lazy-loaded and cached, shared with the
  dashboard screener and indicator heatmap.
- Favorite (starred) pairs, persisted locally.
- Fiat currency icons for 30 currencies in the coin/pair icon component
  (previously only USD/EUR had icons; others fell back to first-letter circles).
- Dynamic ATR/ADR ("AR") take-profit / stop-loss mode in the DCA bot form, with
  an inline indicator config.

### Fixed

- Curated preset ROI now resolves on paper accounts — paper provider names
  (e.g. `paperBybit`) are normalized to their real exchange before the curated
  lookup, so risk-profile cards, the strategies drawer, and the curated strip
  all render ROI on both live and paper accounts.
- Dynamic-AR TP/SL now feeds ATR values into the order engine
  (`TP = price + ATR × multiplier`) instead of silently falling back to the
  percentage value.
- Dynamic-AR price study no longer draws its line on the price chart while still
  feeding order-line prices; TP/SL lines are non-draggable in AR mode.

### Changed

- Bot-form pair screener data now lazy-loads on dialog open (5-min cache) instead
  of walking the full screener in the background on bot-form mount.
- Compact ListModal rows with an expandable detail panel (price, 1h/24h/7d/30d
  changes, volume, market cap, RSI, volatility).

## [2.7.8] - 2026-06-02

### Added

- Hyperliquid builder fees.

## [2.7.7] - 2026-06-02

### Fixed

- Deal drawer chart opened from the Trading terminal no longer always shows "No
  chart data is available for the selected timeframe". The terminal passed the
  deal id as `botId`, breaking the bot lookup (and order/smart-order fetches);
  it now passes the real `botId`. The price chart also falls back to the deal's
  own exchange when the parent bot isn't in the live store (terminal deals,
  whose bots load with `terminal: false`), so the candlestick chart resolves.
- Exchange chip in the deal drawer truncates its label instead of overflowing
  the card when the exchange name is long.
- Bot-form investment slider now percentages off the real free balance of the
  selected asset (read from the live balance store), and never falls back to the
  exchange's total USD balance — that figure is denominated in the settlement
  asset and was wrong for a different quote asset (e.g. USDC vs USDT). A 0 now
  shows as a real 0.

## [2.7.6] - 2026-06-02

### Fixed

- Combo/DCA deal lists no longer merge live and paper deals on a trading-context
  switch. Deal queries now request the `paperContext` field (exposed by the
  backend) so each deal is scoped to its true context instead of being inferred
  from the active mode (which mis-tagged placeholder data during the switch).

### Added

- Trading-mode toggle (badge + sidebar/navbar switches) shows a spinner while
  the newly-selected context's data loads.

## [2.7.5] - 2026-06-02

### Fixed

- Base Order Size input now updates its coin icon when the currency reference
  is switched (base/quote/USD), matching the DCA order amount input. Both inputs
  share `resolveOrderSizeIconSymbol`.
- Footer "Capital required" chip now derives the whole-bot total from the same
  example-orders deal summary the DCA overview "Total Funds" tile uses (new
  `useBotDealCapital` hook), so the two agree when the order size is referenced
  in the base currency — previously the chip recomputed it standalone and
  mismatched.

## [2.7.4] - 2026-06-01

### Fixed

- Closing or canceling a deal now removes it from the active list immediately
  instead of waiting on a websocket update (there is no polling fallback):
  close/cancel/move optimistically update the deal store (cancel → canceled,
  leave/market-close → closed, move → dropped from the bot), and the deals
  list no longer resurrects a just-closed deal from its last-fetch snapshot.

### Changed

- Indicator configuration parity pass: interval-type fields filter their
  options to the selected exchange's supported candle intervals; STOCH band
  fields resolve the correct param key from `stochRange`; related bot-form
  section, indicator-dialog, and bot-card refactors.

## [2.7.3] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- Cancel button on a deal's pending DCA / add-funds / reduce-funds orders
  (parity with the legacy dashboard), with a confirmation dialog. Routes an
  add/reduce-funds order to `cancelPendingAddFundsDealOrder` and a plain
  order to `cancelTerminalDealOrder`, matching legacy.
- Deal detail is deep-linkable: opening a deal reflects `?dealId=` in the
  URL and a direct link re-opens it (one-shot, so Back/Close still work).
- Trial funnel analytics: a `trial_dialog_shown` event (with `source`)
  alongside `trial_started`, via a dedicated `trialEvents` registry.

### Fixed

- Canceling a deal order no longer fails with "Cannot access" — the cancel
  mutations now send the auth token + paper-context like every other call.
- An order canceled in another client no longer reappears — pending orders
  are re-fetched fresh and reconciled instead of restored stale from cache.

### Changed

- Deal cards in the bot drawer read clearly against the panel (elevation
  instead of blending into the glass surface).

## [2.7.2] - 2026-05-31

### Changed

- Bot form save row: cost moved out of the Create button into its own
  credits chip on the left (hover shows the per-component breakdown, now
  with decimals), added a "capital required" chip beside it (same
  token-icon-then-amount format; hover shows base orders / safety orders
  / available balance / % of available), and moved "Save as template"
  into the row's overflow (⋮) menu — so the save row now mirrors the
  backtest row's chips-left / button + menu-right layout. The capital
  chip follows the deposit side, showing the base coin + quantity for
  spot short / COIN-M futures instead of the quote amount.
- Help links across the bot form and the connect-exchange screen now
  render as `HelpArticlePill`s backed by a shared `helpUrl` parser;
  `Tooltip` was slimmed down to reuse them. Corrected/added help-article
  links on several settings rows (DCA type, smart grid orders, profit
  currency, reinvest).

### Fixed

- Saving a bot template with a hotkey no longer throws "Maximum update
  depth exceeded" — the template-shortcut sync effect no longer re-fires
  on the shortcut-store writes it triggers itself.

## [2.7.1] - 2026-05-31

### Added

- Bot events drawer: coin-pair icons and click-to-copy order/deal ID chips.

### Changed

- Bot events drawer now categorizes, searches, and paginates server-side
  (fetches a handful per tab via the `getBotEvents` `category`/`counts`
  fields). The "Recent" tab is the full activity feed; "Deals"/"Alerts" are
  filtered subsets. "Load more" is pinned at the bottom; event messages are
  click-to-expand.

### Fixed

- Bot events: order errors no longer render as completed "Sell Closed" trades;
  the event time is shown once (no longer duplicated); the year is hidden
  unless an event is over a year old.
- `copyToClipboard` falls back to `execCommand` when the async Clipboard API is
  unavailable or blocked, so copy works in more contexts.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-05-30

### Added

- Trial provider adapter (`useTrial` / `registerTrialProvider`) and an
  `exchange.trialPrompt` slot so the connect-exchange picker can offer
  premium exchanges behind a start-trial prompt for trial-eligible users.
- Error bots now surface their failure reason as a tooltip on the status
  chip (bot cards + Trading/Combo/Grid bot lists), via a new optional
  `tooltip` prop on `StatusChip`.

### Changed

- Premium exchanges are now selectable (tagged "Trial") for free users
  who still have a trial available; picking one opens the start-trial
  prompt instead of showing a disabled "(upgrade to use)" row. Once the
  trial is used up they revert to the disabled rows.
- Added `patch-package` with a `@radix-ui/react-compose-refs` patch that
  fixes ref-cleanup handling.

### Fixed

- DCA deal usage % now reads the base side for short spot / COIN-M deals
  instead of always the quote side, which made short combos and coin-m
  deals report 0% usage.

## [2.6.4] - 2026-05-30

### Added

- Top Deals widget on the Overview dashboard: ranks active deals by cost
  (default), value, unrealized PnL, PnL %, realized profit, or age, with a
  card/table view and the ranking selector in the table toolbar.

### Changed

- Login page now reads "Sign in or sign up" with a clearer subheading on
  cloud, so new users see they can create an account from the same page.
- Deal cards now surface the creation date/time as a tooltip on the
  trade-duration chip instead of a dedicated cell.

### Fixed

- Deal card hover actions are scoped per card again, so hovering one card no
  longer reveals every card's action buttons when shown inside a dashboard
  widget.

## [2.6.3] - 2026-05-29

### Added

- `isTrialAvailable` user query and an auth-store `refreshUser` action to
  re-fetch the user (subscription, balance, credits) after a plan change
  without clearing the session on a transient failure.

### Changed

- DCA "Total Funds" tile now shows base-currency funds for spot-short and
  coin-M futures bots (quote `$` figure unchanged for everything else).
- Base order section stays visible in DCA strategy settings even when
  editing a bot that has active deals.
- Error screen now includes the error stack and React component stack.

## [2.6.2] - 2026-05-29

### Changed

- Live stores hydration is now serialized through a single
  `liveStoreHydrationQueue` so the eight heavy IndexedDB-persisted
  stores (dca/combo/grid/hedge bots, transactions, deals, orders) read
  their blobs one at a time with a `requestIdleCallback` yield between
  each. Peak hydration heap drops from roughly the sum of all eight
  structured-clone payloads to roughly the largest single payload,
  which prevents the OOM tab crashes a heavy-trading user could hit on
  Windows Chrome (lower per-tab heap budget than macOS). No data or
  API change: existing stores just opt in via the new
  `createQueuedIndexedDBStorage` factory. Lightweight stores (UI
  settings, theme, etc.) keep `createIndexedDBStorage` — the queue
  overhead isn't worth it for small blobs.

## [2.6.1] - 2026-05-28

### Changed

- Bot forms: Quick / Manual toggle uses a clearly-visible primary-tinted
  pill for the selected option (matches the existing subtab pattern)
  instead of a subtle card-surface fill.
- Bot forms: when exchange/pair info loads, persisted amounts below the
  exchange minimum are now silently raised to the minimum (rounded up
  to the next valid step) instead of being shown as validation errors.
  Covers DCA base order + DCA step, Combo base + step, Grid budget,
  Terminal, and both Hedge legs. The bumped value is persisted back
  through the form's setter; values the user is editing are left
  alone. A single "Adjusted amounts to exchange minimum" info toast
  fires per bump pass.
- Info toasts trimmed across the app: removed the noisy "Downloading
  candles in background" and the per-pair "User fee for X is N%"
  notices (both fire during routine form interaction). Converted six
  user-action-with-caveat toasts from `info` to `warning`, and the
  backtest-requested confirmation to `success`. Added a Toasts policy
  section to `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- Admin page to manage running containers, choose exchanges, and upgrade images.

## [2.5.2] - 2026-05-28

### Fixed

- Bot forms (DCA / Terminal / Combo / Grid / Hedge): removed unintended
  auto-focus on the budget / base-order input so opening a new or edit
  page no longer jumps to that field.
- Combo bot form: restored the Backtest period / timeframe / run row
  above the Save Bot button (it had stopped rendering for combo).
- Combo bot form: budget input now shows the actual quote symbol
  instead of the literal "Quote" / "BAL 0 QUOTE" placeholder — combo
  inherits the normalized pair-key lookup from DCA's trading context.
- Combo bot form: "Combo grid strategy" section no longer introduces a
  border / extra elevation inside the parent card; matches the
  surrounding form per DESIGN_SYSTEM.md.
- Combo bot form: DCA Overview Total funds now includes the notional
  cost reserved by minigrid orders, not just the base order.
- Combo bot form: DCA Overview defaults to the orders table and hides
  the price graph — the graph rendered minigrid lines as if they were
  stop-loss / take-profit and didn't scale to combos with many grids.
  DCA and Grid forms keep their graph.

## [2.5.1] - 2026-05-28

### Changed

- Grid bot strategy settings: on futures exchanges (linear or coin-m),
  Profit Currency and Order Fixed In are now auto-set to match the
  margin asset and the corresponding rows are hidden — the user can't
  earn or denominate orders in anything other than the margin asset.
  Linear futures: `profitCurrency='quote'`, `orderFixedIn='base'`.
  Coin-m futures: `profitCurrency='quote'`, `orderFixedIn='quote'`.
- Grid bot strategy settings: replaced the broken custom Leverage input
  with the same Margin & Leverage block DCA/Combo use — Margin Type
  selector (isolated/cross), leverage NumberInput + LeverageSlider,
  per-pair max-leverage cap from `getLeverageBracket`, paper-trading +
  active-deals locking, and the standard notices. Factored the JSX into
  a shared `<MarginLeverageBlock />` component so the three bot types
  stay in sync. Fixes the `Leverage ? [object Object]` rendering that
  came from stringifying the GridLeverageState object.

### Fixed

- CoinSelect: picking a new pair via the swap (↔) icon on the trading-
  pair chip now actually updates the chart, backtest button, example
  orders, and risk-profile prices. The dialog returned a dashed
  `BTC-USDT` and the replace path wrote it straight to `formData.pair`,
  but the rest of the form keys `pairMetadata` by the undashed form
  (`BTCUSDT`) — the downstream lookup missed and every dependent panel
  stayed on the old pair. Normalize the symbol on write to match the
  regular add-pair flow.
- DCA bot view dialog (`/bot/view/<id>?tab=settings`): "DCA order
  amount" fields showed the USDT icon regardless of the bot's actual
  quote asset (e.g. a Hyperliquid BTC-USDC bot still displayed USDT).
  Root cause: `DCASettings` called `useDcaTradingContext(formData)`
  without the `bot` fallback, so when `ReadOnlyBotForm` seeded an empty
  `formData.pairMetadata` (no exchange query in readonly), the trading
  context's `quoteAsset` resolved to `undefined` → CoinIcon defaulted to
  USDT. Strategy Settings already passed `bot` for the same fallback;
  DCA Settings now matches.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- Unified bot-list KPI strip: a shared `BotListStatsBoxes` component
  rendering Active Bots / Total P&L / Capital Deployed across DCA,
  Grid, Combo, HedgeDca, HedgeCombo, and the Trading page. Single
  source of truth via `computeBotListStats` + `combineBotListStats`
  in `useBotListStats`; each bot type passes its records through a
  small adapter into the same normalized shape.
- Hedge DCA / Hedge Combo bot list pages: KPI stats strip in the
  header (was previously stats-less). Sums per-leg `profit/assets/
dealsInBot` since the hedge wrapper doesn't aggregate those.
- IndicatorConfigurationModal / InlineIndicatorConfig: per-field
  global-variable binding via `FieldVariableBinding` — bind indicator
  parameters to global variables instead of hard-coding values.
- DetailDrawer body: bottom spacer on mobile so the last item clears
  the floating bottom-nav and remains scrollable into view.

### Changed

- VariableChip: more compact layout (smaller padding, rounded-lg, no
  Link2 icon prefix) to fit denser indicator/setting rows.
- EmptyState placement on TradingBots / GridBots / ComboBots /
  HedgeDcaBots / HedgeComboBots: hoisted above the DataTable instead
  of being passed via `emptyContent`, matching the page-level
  empty-state pattern used elsewhere.
- DrawerDealsTable: trade-row clicks no longer force-open the detail
  drawer; respects the user's previously-selected drawer state.
- Exchanges page: `WidgetContainer layout="grid"` → `"flex"`; lets
  the inner exchange cards / table choose their own width without
  being stretched by an outer grid.

### Fixed

- ComboBots stats: "Accumulated Profit" and "Profit By Day" were both
  showing the same value as "Total Profit". Replaced with the unified
  KPI strip; the duplicate-value placeholders are gone.
- GridBots stats: "Accumulated Profit" duplicated "Total Profit", and
  "Profit By Day / Recent daily" was actually today's profit, not a
  daily average. Replaced with the unified KPI strip.
- DCA bot stats `activeBots` only counted `status === 'open'` — bots
  in `error/range/monitoring` were missing. Now uses canonical
  `isBotActive` from `botStatusUtils.ts`.
- Trading page stats aggregator: missing `'error'` from the active
  status list when fetching DCA/Combo/Grid bots — error-state bots
  were excluded from Total P&L and capital totals.
- Trading page Total Profit no longer drops Grid bots' unrealized
  PnL on the floor (the per-deal aggregator hardcoded `0` for Grid).
  Replaced with the bot-list aggregator that sums Grid profits in
  full.

## [2.4.2] - 2026-05-27

### Added

- NavigationSidebar: third "hidden" mode in addition to pinned /
  unpinned. Drag the right-edge handle further left from collapsed to
  fully hide; the sidebar reappears as an overlay when the cursor
  hovers the left viewport edge. Persisted via
  `navigationSidebarHidden` in `uiStore`. Short rightward drag from
  hidden restores hover-mode; long drag re-pins.
- OpenOrdersWidget: totals row footer for Realized P&L, Unrealized
  P&L, Net P&L, Cost, and Notional Value columns. Color-coded P&L
  totals (success/destructive) and respects privacy mode.
- BotForm: reset scroll to top when toggling between Quick and Manual
  modes so the scroll-spy doesn't promote whichever section happened
  to be visible at the previous offset.

### Fixed

- BotFormAlertSummary: long validation chips (e.g. "Base order amount
  must be more than 10 USDC") now truncate inside their parent row.
  Previous SettingsAlert-only fix didn't help because the chip lived
  inside a content-sized button → div chain where `max-w-full` had
  nothing definite to reference. Propagate `w-full min-w-0` down the
  alert summary's wrapper and trigger button so the chip's `max-w-full`
  resolves to the actual alerts-row width.

## [2.4.1] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed

- SettingsAlert: long warning/error chips (e.g. "Base order amount
  must be more than 10 USDC") now actually truncate inside their
  parent. Previous fix used `inline-flex max-w-full`, which doesn't
  reliably constrain when the parent has no explicit width — switched
  to `flex w-fit max-w-full` so the chip stays content-sized but is
  firmly capped at the parent's resolved width, and the inner span's
  `truncate` kicks in with an ellipsis.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-05-27

### Changed

- Single-bot Duplicate (DCA / Grid / Combo) now navigates to
  `/<route>/new?load=<id>` and opens the new-bot form pre-seeded from
  the source, matching the hedge clone flow. Previously the non-hedge
  flows silently created a new bot via API and only fired a toast.
  Bulk-clone paths (where they exist) keep the API-only behavior.

### Fixed

- DCA bot details "Clone" button navigated to `/bot/new?clone=<id>`,
  a param nothing read; switched to the `?load=` convention so it
  actually seeds the form.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-05-27

### Added

- `firstToolbarActionsCompact`, `customToolbarActionsCompact`,
  `finalToolbarActionsCompact` on DataTable — caller supplies a narrow
  variant of any toolbar action. When provided the responsive row swaps
  to the compact content under pressure instead of moving the action to
  the overflow menu, so caller-supplied buttons stay visible at any
  width.
- ResponsiveButtonRow publishes `onLayoutMetrics` with the actual width
  it needs to render every visible button at full size, letting the
  data-table size the inline search dynamically — no hard-coded width
  threshold.

### Changed

- ResponsiveButtonRow overflow algorithm simplified back to pure
  priority-based progression: compact lowest-priority buttons first,
  overflow lowest-priority first only after full compaction. The
  "smart single removal" heuristic was hiding caller-passed actions
  too eagerly; pure priority respects the caller's importance order.
- All custom toolbar actions across pages now share the ghost+labeled
  style with icon-only compact fallbacks: TradingBots / ComboBots /
  GridBots Archive toggles, GlobalVariables Refresh / Save / Cancel /
  Import / Add Variable, Exchanges Add Exchange, OpenOrdersWidget /
  DrawerDealsTable status filter and Open Deal button.

## [2.2.1] - 2026-05-27

### Changed

- Toolbar custom actions (Archive toggle on Trading/Combo/Grid bots,
  Refresh on Global Variables) now use the same ghost+labeled style
  as the standard toolbar buttons. Cards-mode Filters button on the
  bot listings switches to ghost too.
- Inline-search expansion threshold lowered from 900px to 400px so
  most tables show the expanded input by default; the icon-only fallback
  is reserved for genuinely cramped toolbars.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-05-27

### Added

- DataTable toolbar buttons now show icon + label (Resize, Filters,
  Columns, Cards) when there's room; compactContent stays icon-only
  for narrow widths.
- Search input collapses to a magnifying-glass button below a high
  toolbar-width threshold and expands as an absolute overlay on tap
  — overlay has rounded corners and ring border so it reads as a
  distinct element on any surface.

### Changed

- ResponsiveButtonRow overflow algorithm: progressive compaction is
  now interleaved with a single-button overflow probe. After each
  compaction step we re-check whether overflowing one wide hidable
  button alone would now fit — so labels drop one at a time and a
  wide caller-provided action overflows before utility icons.
- Responsive container switched to `flex-nowrap` + `min-w-0` so
  the row no longer briefly wraps to two lines during resize.
- All DataTable toolbar + pagination buttons use `variant="ghost"`
  (filter still uses `default` when active).
- DataTable toolbar button priorities reshuffled so card/list-view
  toggle sits just below column-visibility (which is neverOverflow).

### Fixed

- ResponsiveButtonRow no longer reserves overflow-menu space
  preemptively when there are no custom menu items; reservation
  happens only when a button actually needs to overflow.

## [2.1.3] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed

- Notifications: bot rows now mark-as-read server-side via
  `deleteBotMessage` (parity with legacy). Previously the single-row
  action sent `NaN` to `readPlatformNotificationByUser` and the bulk
  action only wrote to localStorage, leaving read state per-device
  and out of sync with the server.

### Removed

- `localStorage["readBotNotifications"]` client-side read tracking
  for bot notifications; bot read state is now backend-owned. The
  stale key is purged once on load.

## [2.1.2] - 2026-05-27

### Added

- Hedge bot tables (DCA + Combo): Name, Cost, Max cost, Avg daily,
  Annualized columns — closes the remaining gap with the standalone
  trading-bots table.

## [2.1.1] - 2026-05-27

### Changed

- Card primitive: no default border (surface contrast separates cards
  from the page background per DESIGN_SYSTEM.md §3); padding now uses
  spacing tokens (`py-md md:py-lg`, `px-md md:px-lg`) so it tracks
  compact / comfortable density.

### Fixed

- Card primitive: `min-w-0` so wide children (tables) shrink within
  constrained parents — their own `overflow-x-auto` actually scrolls
  instead of blowing out the layout.
- Settings page: horizontal-scroll bug on tablet / mobile when the
  API-keys or notification tables were visible.
- Settings page: spacing now matches Overview's density-toggle
  convention (`xs` compact ↔ `md` comfortable), outer page padding
  comes from `WidgetContainer` instead of being double-applied.
- Settings sidebar nav: rounded corners and outer margins on mobile.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-05-27

### Added

- Hedge bot card: full info parity with the standalone trading-bots
  card — Cost (current / max), Avg Daily, Annualized, total Deals; per
  leg now also shows Usage, Cost, Deals, Profit, and Unrealized PnL.
- Hedge bot card menu: full action set (Star, Start/Stop, Restart,
  Edit, Clone, View Backtests, Share Configuration, Duplicate, Archive,
  Delete) via the shared BotActionsMenuItems.
- Hedge bot tables (DCA + Combo): Long exchange, Short exchange, and
  Deals columns, plus a per-row actions cell mirroring the card menu.
- Hedge bot Clone: list-page Clone navigates to `/hedge/{bot|combo}/new?load=<id>`,
  the new-bot form fetches the source hedge bot, seeds both legs, and
  appends "(copy)" to each leg's name — matches the legacy duplicate
  flow.

### Changed

- Hedge bot card: leg tiles now use `bg-card` over the outer `bg-muted`
  (no border) per the surface ladder, replacing the previous
  border-heavy inset.
- HedgeBotFormProvider: `?load=<botId>` works in create mode too (the
  fetch was previously gated on edit mode, so clone-from-template was
  silently a no-op).
- useBotDelete: removes hedge bots from the hedge live stores so the
  list updates immediately on delete instead of waiting for a websocket
  refresh.
- computeHedgeUnPnl: also returns combined avgDaily / avgDailyPerc /
  annualizedReturn and per-leg cost, max cost, unrealized PnL, and
  utilisation so the card can render them without re-deriving.

## [2.0.2] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed

- SettingsAlert: long warning/error chips now truncate inside their
  container instead of overflowing the parent.
- NavigationSidebar: stop the hover-elevated sidebar from flickering on
  top of an open drawer/dialog while it is being resized — CSS
  `:has([role="dialog"][aria-modal="true"])` rule keeps the sidebar
  below the drawer whenever a modal is open.
- Bot drawer sticky tab nav: bumped z-index above the section content
  so inner Tabs labels (deal-start modes, take-profit type) no longer
  bleed through the translucent sticky bar.
- CoinSelect: drop the redesign-only quote/base filter that hid valid
  pairs when replacing the only configured pair.

### Changed

- SettingsRow: transparent by default. Stacked rows now rely on
  spacing/typography instead of an extra `bg-card` surface.
- Bot form sub-nav (`ScrollableFormTabNavigation`): square pill tabs
  (`rounded-md`) with `border-primary/60 bg-primary/10` active state;
  removed the double bottom-border and tightened padding/height.
- Read-only bot form sticky nav: floating rounded bar with translucent
  `bg-background/80` + `backdrop-blur` (matches the edit form pattern).
- DealStartSettings: shortened pair-prioritization descriptions to
  match the cleaner row spacing.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed

- DataTable: actions column now renders last and stays pinned to the right
  edge. Two underlying bugs are addressed: `defaultColumnOrder` was emitting
  `accessorKey` strings react-table couldn't resolve (so it auto-appended
  mismatched columns past any right-pin), and the effective `state.columnOrder`
  did not reorder pinned columns. Pinned-right columns are also merged with
  defaults so stale persisted preferences no longer suppress a newly declared
  default pin.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-26

### Added

- First release of the v2 dashboard as `@gainium/main-dash-sh`. Vite/React SPA
  replacing the previous Next.js `main-dash` build (now shipped as the
  `frontend-legacy` image).
- Hedge bots: full Quick + Manual editor, local backtesting (no SSB variant),
  history table with bulk Delete + Export-as-JSON, Combined / Long / Short
  active view, DataTable-driven Backtests insights tab with count badge.
- Risk:Reward runtime: chart indicator callback wired through
  `RiskRewardRuntimeContext` so indicator-driven SL/TP updates land in the form.
- Backtest UX parity with DCA/Combo: footer inline progress, dialog progress,
  candle caching, profit-currency derived from `futures/coinm/profitCurrency`.
- TradingView chart: `iframe_loading_same_origin` enabled (load-bearing for
  v28 chunk loading); custom indicator value callback plumbed through
  `custom_indicators_getter`.
