/**
 * Column explanations for the bot list tables (DCA, Combo, Grid, Hedge).
 *
 * They render as the header tooltip via `meta.description` (see
 * `ColumnDescriptionMeta` in `components/ui/data-table/data-table.tsx`).
 *
 * Two rules for anything added here:
 *
 * 1. **Say what the number is made of.** Every money column is a sum of named
 *    parts and every percentage has a denominator; the point of these strings
 *    is that the user doesn't have to guess which. The three PnL columns use
 *    different denominators on purpose (max cost / current cost / initial
 *    balance), so each one states its own.
 * 2. **Keep the vocabulary fixed.** Realized PnL = closed only, Unrealized
 *    PnL = open only, Net PnL = the two added together. That triple is the
 *    same on every bot type; only the field it is computed from changes.
