/**
 * Deal-derived half of the DCA Analysis widget, computed server-side.
 *
 * The widget used to fold this out of the deals themselves, via two
 * `useBotSpecificDeals` subscriptions (open + closed). That path fetched 100
 * full deal documents per page — the `dcaDealFragment` is ~600 selected
 * fields — and its display loader stopped at 5 pages, so any bot past 500
 * deals was silently analysed on a subset, and re-fetched all of it every 30s.
 * All of that existed to read one integer per deal.
 *
 * main-app now returns the histogram directly. `dcas` is the number of DCA
 * (safety) orders a deal actually filled, `deals` how many of the bot's deals
 * filled exactly that many. Buckets are RAW — clamping them to the bot's
 * current configured DCA count is the caller's job, because that count comes
 * from the example-orders projection engine and not from the deals.
