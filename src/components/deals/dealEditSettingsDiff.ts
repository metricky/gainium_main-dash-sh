    // It is on the list at all because DCASettings renders the combo "DCA

    // fragment nor the DCA deal fragment selects `gridLevel` — so the diff
    // below found a change on every single save. `orderSize` and `step` are
    // genuinely inert (both input sets declare them); `gridLevel` was not.
