/**
 * Pair market-data adapter — the extension point shared code (the bot
 * pair selector, `CoinFilter` / `ListModal`) uses to sort and decorate
 * the trading-pair list by market metrics it cannot fetch itself.
 *
 * Cloud registers a hook backed by the screener (`/api/screener`) and the
 * curated-presets leaderboard, returning a `lookup(baseAsset)` over
 * marketcap / volume / 24h change / best curated ROI. Self-hosted / sh
 * builds leave the registration unset and the no-op default returns
 * `null` for every coin — the selector then falls back to alphabetical
 * sort with no ROI badge, since there is no screener or curated worker
 * in sh.
 *
 * Mirrors the curatedPresets / analytics / license adapter pattern:
 * register synchronously at boot from `main.tsx` so the number of hooks
 * called inside `usePairMarketData()` stays stable across renders.
